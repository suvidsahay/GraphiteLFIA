# Overview

The 2022 Luzon earthquake, a significant seismic event, was characterized by a series of geological investigations aimed at understanding its implications and the underlying geological structures. The research workflow involved a two-step process: first, a one-dimensional (1D) reference velocity model inversion was conducted using the VELEST program (Kissling et al., 1994), followed by the determination of three-dimensional (3D) P- and S-wave velocity models utilizing the Local Tomography Software (LOTOS) (Koulakov, 2009)[1][2].
The study revealed high-velocity zones associated with earthquake activity, interpreted as subducting slabs. Notably, the South China Sea slab exhibited clearly defined high-velocity anomalies and earthquake distributions, whereas the resolution of the Philippine Sea Plate was comparatively less distinct[3][4]. This analysis underscored the regions of magma generation and migration within the affected area, where S-wave velocity exhibited higher sensitivity to fluid content, leading to significant negative anomalies and elevated Vp/Vs ratios[3][5].

# Seismic Activity

The M_w 7.0 Abra earthquake, which occurred on July 27, 2022, underscored the seismic activity prevalent along an unmapped blind fault located beneath the Cordillera Central[6][7]. Historical data indicates that numerous earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 or greater have occurred within a 250 km (155 mi) radius of this event. Notably, the most significant of these was a magnitude 7.7 strike-slip earthquake that struck on July 16, 1990, approximately 215 km (134 mi) south of the 2022 earthquake, resulting in at least 1,600 fatalities and over 3,000 injuries. This earlier earthquake also led to severe geological effects, including landslides, liquefaction, subsidence, and the formation of sand boils in the Baguio–Cabanatuan–Dagupan area[7][8].
Seismic activity in this region is primarily influenced by the tectonic dynamics associated with the Philippine Sea plate, which has been responsible for the generation of seven great earthquakes (M\u003e8.0) and approximately 250 large events (M\u003e7) in the surrounding areas[9]. Furthermore, new fault systems have been identified in Batangas province, including the Lobo Fault System and the Calubcub Fault, contributing to the complex tectonic setting that characterizes southwestern Luzon. These areas have experienced significant seismic activity, resulting in notable structural damage and geotechnical phenomena such as liquefaction and landslides[10].
Subduction zones, such as those found in the Philippines, are recognized as some of the most seismically active regions on Earth, exhibiting a wide range of volcanic activity, earthquakes, and varying arc curvatures[11]. The nature of subduction can be complicated by preexisting fossil ridges, which were former spreading centers. These features can significantly alter the behavior of seismic activity and volcanic processes, sometimes leading to the development of volcanic gap zones due to the interactions between the subducting slab and the mantle wedge[12][3]. Such dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the seismic risks and patterns in the region, particularly in the wake of recent earthquakes.

# Earthquake Details

The 2022 Luzon earthquake occurred on July 27, 2022, and was initially reported as having a magnitude of 7.3 Ms by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). However, this was later revised to a magnitude of 7.0 Mw. The earthquake's epicenter was located approximately 3 km N 25° W of Tayum, Abra, at a depth of 17 km (11 mi) [13][14]. Despite being relatively shallow, the earthquake did not exhibit surface ruptures. Analysis of its focal mechanism indicates a rupture along a reverse fault, characterized by either a steep northeast-southwest striking plane with a dip of 69° or a shallow north-south dipping plane of 8° [14][15].
Prior to this event, numerous significant earthquakes had been recorded in the region. Within 250 km (155 mi) of the July 27 earthquake, multiple earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 or larger had occurred. The most notable among these was a magnitude 7.7 strike-slip earthquake on July 16, 1990, located approximately 215 km (134 mi) south of the 2022 earthquake, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,600 individuals and injuries to more than 3,000 people. This event also caused extensive geological impacts, including landslides, liquefaction, subsidence, and sand boils, particularly in the Baguio–Cabanatuan–Dagupan area [16][17][3].
In terms of seismic data, the earthquake's P- and S-wave arrival times were meticulously handpicked from the PHIVOLCS-IES station waveform, facilitating accurate travel time calculations for each event-station pair. This meticulous process enhanced the quality of the travel time database, resulting in a comprehensive collection of 92,950 P-wave readings and 49,087 S-wave readings from 21,134 seismic events [8][18]. The epicenter of the 2022 earthquake was precisely recorded at geographical coordinates of 17.63°N, 120.63°E, at a depth of 15 km [15][12].

# Impact

The 2022 Luzon earthquake had significant and widespread effects across the region, with a reported eleven fatalities, including four from landslides, and at least 616 injuries[3][2]. More than 513,330 individuals were affected, resulting in the displacement of approximately 57,022 people[3][19]. The disaster caused extensive damage to infrastructure, with a total of 35,798 homes impacted, including 686 that were completely destroyed. Additionally, 177 healthcare facilities were damaged and over 8,000 schools experienced varying degrees of destruction[19][6].
The total estimated economic loss from the earthquake was substantial, amounting to around ₱79,096,227 billion (approximately US$34 million) due to damage to various sectors, including agriculture and irrigation systems[3][19][2]. Specific reports indicated that damages to agriculture were estimated at ₱56.4 million (US$1.02 million), while irrigation infrastructure incurred damages worth approximately ₱22.7 million (US$407 thousand) [6][4].
In urban areas, the earthquake was felt strongly in Metro Manila, where it caused minor damage to a hospital and several buildings, prompting temporary suspension of the Manila Metro Rail Transit System services during peak hours[19][2]. Other regions, such as Apayao and Ilocos Norte, reported structural damage to schools and public buildings, with significant impacts documented in the mountainous areas, where landslides and liquefaction occurred[3][2][6].
Poor engineering practices and the use of substandard materials were major contributing factors to the extensive structural damage observed in several affected areas[15][2]. In the aftermath, recovery efforts were initiated, focusing on restoring power and access to water supplies, as well as clearing debris from landslides that blocked roadways[15][3].

# Response and Recovery

Following the 2022 Luzon earthquake, immediate response efforts were coordinated by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which reported that 421,728 individuals were affected, with 65,858 displaced persons requiring assistance[20]. Initial relief operations focused on providing emergency supplies, such as food, water, and medicine, to those impacted by the disaster. In the wake of these immediate needs, a general fund was proposed to support longer-term recovery efforts, enabling local organizations to manage the transition from emergency relief to sustained recovery initiatives[14][18].

## Financing and Support

Financing the repair of damaged homes emerged as a critical challenge during the recovery phase. Many homeowners were abroad or residing in different parts of the country, leading to landlord absenteeism and complicating the decision-making process for ancestral properties owned by multiple family members[18]. Suggested solutions to address these financial challenges included the granting of tax breaks and the establishment of a legal framework for a general fund to assist with repairs. Additionally, stakeholders advocated for exploring grants or subsidies to aid homeowners in their restoration efforts[15][18].

## Collaborative Efforts

The recovery process also highlighted the need for better coordination among various agencies. Senators, including Alan Peter Cayetano and Juan Miguel Zubiri, called for a more accountable structure by proposing the creation of a dedicated department for disaster response, to streamline efforts across the 44 agencies currently involved in disaster management[17][2]. This sentiment was echoed by local stakeholders during town hall meetings, where proposals included the formation of specialized emergency response teams, capacity-building sessions, and refined guidelines for home restoration[8].

## Community Involvement

Awareness and mobilization of assistance were bolstered by organizations like UNESCO, which provided significant funding to support the recovery of cultural heritage sites affected by the earthquake. Contributions reached P2 million, alongside in-kind support, greatly aiding the conservation of these important cultural treasures[21][18]. Local homeowners were encouraged to re-establish associations to facilitate knowledge sharing and communal support in addressing recovery challenges, ensuring that the community was actively engaged in the rebuilding process[8][18].

# Aftermath

Following the 2022 Luzon earthquake, significant efforts were made to assess and address the impacts on affected communities. As of July 27, 2022, there had been 254 recorded aftershocks, with magnitudes ranging from 1.5 to 4.7, highlighting ongoing seismic activity in the region[4][19]. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) warned residents to prepare for further aftershocks, although no tsunami warning was issued as the quake was detected inland[20][19].
In the wake of the earthquake, a series of knowledge-sharing sessions were organized to facilitate discussions on recovery efforts, particularly in Vigan, which was significantly impacted. These sessions covered various topics including disaster risk management for cultural heritage, the evolution of local conservation practices, and the characteristics of traditional building materials[3]. A town hall meeting gathered Vigan homeowners and local stakeholders, allowing them to voice their concerns and suggestions regarding recovery efforts. Homeowners advocated for the creation of a specialized emergency response team and emphasized the need for more capacity-building sessions to enhance skills and knowledge for conservation efforts[4][3].
Financial support for recovery efforts was also notable, with assistance reaching approximately P2 million, supplemented by in-kind contributions. This funding, aided by the UNESCO Heritage Emergency Fund, has been crucial in conserving both Philippine and global cultural treasures[10]. Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. reported that the earthquake resulted in significant damage across more than 200 towns in 15 provinces, with numerous landslides recorded[22][20]. The total economic loss was estimated at around $75 million, including substantial damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and irrigation systems[19][10].
