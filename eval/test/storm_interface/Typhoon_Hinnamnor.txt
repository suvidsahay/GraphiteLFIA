The Korean Meteorological Administration issued unprecedented warnings, classifying the storm's wind speeds among the most severe observed in recent years, leading to flight cancellations, school closures, and mobilization of emergency response teams.[5][6] In the Philippines, where the storm was referred to as \"Yolanda,\" the aftermath saw an overwhelming need for humanitarian assistance due to the extensive damage, particularly in the eastern regions of Samar and Leyte, with the Philippine government reporting a death toll of over 6,300.[7][8]
In the wake of Typhoon Hinnamnor, relief efforts were hampered by severe damage to infrastructure, complicating access to affected areas and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. International aid organizations and countries, including the United States, South Africa, and several others, mobilized to provide essential support, including food, medical supplies, and logistical assistance for recovery efforts.[9][10] Furthermore, the disaster underscored the pressing need for improved disaster preparedness and response strategies in light of the increasing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones attributed to climate change, with concerns over the future trajectory of such storms being a topic of ongoing research and discussion.[11][12]

# Meteorological History

## Formation and Early Development

Typhoon Hinnamnor developed in late August 2022 and underwent significant transformations as it progressed. Initially, the typhoon remained relatively small and was observed to move westward from August 27 to 30, 2022, as indicated by high-resolution satellite imagery and re-analysis data. During this period, the typhoon's cloud structure began to gather, ultimately forming an eye by August 29[1]. The presence of high water vapor content around the typhoon was noted, which is essential for its intensification.

## Intensification and Impact

On September 3, Hinnamnor stalled over the sea south of Okinawa, leading to an expansion of its area with high water vapor content. It then began a northward movement, transitioning into a severe tropical storm (STY) on September 4. By this time, significant changes were observed in the upper ocean conditions, with intensive vertical mixing and upwelling occurring due to the storm's influence[2]. The increase in wave height and mean wave period was also documented, with maximum significant wave heights exceeding 7 meters noted on the right-hand side of the cyclone track[3].

## Observational Data and Analysis

Observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-2) provided critical insights into the storm's dynamics. For instance, a GPM/DPR observation indicated a relatively weak precipitation area northwest of the storm center as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around September 6[1]. Additionally, remote sensing data revealed significant decreases in surface heat fluxes, particularly the sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF), as the storm passed, highlighting the interaction between the ocean and atmosphere during the typhoon's lifecycle[2].

# Impact

## Evacuations and Preparations

On November 8, 2013, in anticipation of Typhoon Hinnamnor, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng activated the highest state of preparedness in Vietnam. This led to the evacuation of approximately 600,000 individuals across southern and central provinces, while an additional 200,000 were evacuated in northern provinces. Alerts were disseminated to 85,328 seagoing vessels with a collective crew of 385,372, instructing them to seek safer waters ahead of the storm. The government sought assistance from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines to shelter fishermen in need. Concerns were heightened due to the damage already inflicted by previous typhoons Wutip and Nari, as many homes had only received makeshift repairs. Roughly 460,000 military personnel and various authorities were mobilized to aid in evacuation efforts, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of schools on November 11[4].

## Destruction and Humanitarian Crisis

Typhoon Hinnamnor, also referred to as Yolanda in the Philippines, inflicted catastrophic damage, particularly in the eastern regions of Samar and Leyte. The storm left cities and towns in Leyte largely devastated, prompting the Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas to describe the scale of the required relief operation as overwhelming, with some areas resembling a \"wasteland of mud and debris.\" By April 17, 2016, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) confirmed a death toll of 6,300 across the country, predominantly in Eastern Visayas, although the true number of fatalities remains uncertain. Additionally, the typhoon resulted in 28,688 injuries, destroyed over half a million homes, and damaged nearly 590,000 others[4][5].

## Infrastructure and Relief Challenges

In the aftermath of Typhoon Hinnamnor, extreme damage to infrastructure hindered relief efforts significantly. Although aid was flown into local airports, the majority remained stranded due to blocked roads. By November 13, it was reported that only 20% of the affected population in Tacloban was receiving aid. The lack of clean water forced some residents to dig up water pipes for boiling, while others sought evacuation via C-130 cargo planes amidst chaotic conditions. The absence of electricity limited flight operations to daylight hours, further complicating evacuations. Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, head of a UN disaster assessment coordination team, remarked on the \"destruction on a massive scale\" in Tacloban, comparing it to the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami[4][5].
In the weeks following the typhoon, many regions, particularly Leyte and Samar, remained without power, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis as the affected population faced dire shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical supplies[4][5]. The United Nations expressed concerns regarding the high risk of disease spread due to these shortages, with casualties reported as the situation continued to deteriorate[5].

# Response

## Humanitarian Assistance

In response to Typhoon Hinnamnor, various international and local organizations mobilized to provide humanitarian aid to affected regions. The United Nations activated its Cluster System to facilitate coordinated relief efforts among humanitarian organizations, addressing critical needs such as health, shelter, and nutrition for the survivors. The UN emphasized the significant challenges posed by damaged infrastructure, which hindered access to many areas still in need of assistance[6].

## International Support

Numerous countries contributed to the relief efforts, reflecting global solidarity in times of crisis. For instance, South Africa dispatched a delegation of medics and aid workers to support relief operations, while Algeria pledged $3 million worth of rice to assist the affected communities. Colombia expressed its sorrow regarding the disaster's impact and offered to collaborate with the Philippine government in recovery efforts, alongside pledges from Chile and Mexico, which donated significant amounts of aid[7][6].

## U.S. Involvement

The United States provided substantial humanitarian assistance, with an estimated $143 million allocated for disaster response and recovery. This included vital support for food, health, shelter, and sanitation needs. The U.S. military played a crucial role in logistics, facilitating the transport of relief supplies and assisting in reopening damaged infrastructure, such as airports, to enable further aid deliveries[7][6]. USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was deployed to lead these efforts, demonstrating the commitment to building a robust response framework that connects national capabilities with local community needs[7][6].

## Preparedness and Recovery

Lessons learned from previous disasters, particularly Typhoon Haiyan, influenced the preparedness strategies employed during the response to Typhoon Hinnamnor. Philippine authorities, with assistance from USAID, enhanced their response readiness through improved logistics, prepositioning of supplies, and early warning systems. This proactive approach was evidenced when local response efforts effectively aided communities impacted by subsequent severe weather events, highlighting an increased resilience in disaster preparedness and recovery[7][6].

# Meteorological Data

## Observations During Typhoon Hinnamnor

The meteorological observations of Typhoon Hinnamnor provide critical insights into its behavior and impact. Notably, GPM/DPR observations indicated a precipitation area northwest of the low-pressure center just after Hinnamnor transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 6, 2022, at around 21:02. The altitude of the precipitation top was measured at approximately 5-6 km, revealing a relatively weak precipitation area compared to previous observations during the storm's more intense phases[1].

## Wind Speed Estimation

Accurate wind speed estimation is vital for assessing a typhoon's strength and potential hazards. Historically, methods for observing wind speeds in tropical systems have faced challenges, particularly in regions where wind speeds exceed 20 m/s. The use of ALOS-2 data provided a breakthrough in measuring the local wind speed distribution associated with Typhoon Hinnamnor. For instance, wind gusts of up to 84 knots (approximately 43 m/s) were recorded on Maejuk-Ri island as the eye of the typhoon passed, with forecasts predicting maximum winds between 80 to 100 knots at landfall[8][9].

## Environmental Conditions

The meteorological analysis around Japan from August 27 to September 3 highlighted the presence of high water vapor content, which was significant for typhoon development. Initial observations showed that Hinnamnor remained relatively small and moved westward before stalling south of Okinawa, leading to an increase in high water vapor content. This condition likely contributed to the eventual intensification and northward movement of the storm, bringing severe weather to the Okinawa region[1][10].
During the period leading up to and following the typhoon, ocean satellite observations indicated a marked decrease in sea surface temperature (SST) due to vertical mixing and heavy upwelling. Pre-storm SSTs were above 30.0 °C, which is conducive to tropical cyclone formation. However, post-storm conditions demonstrated a significant reduction in SST due to the impacts of Hinnamnor, showcasing the cyclone's effect on local oceanography[2][11].

## Impacts and Warnings

The Korea Meteorological Administration issued warnings of very strong winds and heavy rains across southern cities as the typhoon approached, with wind speeds categorized under a severe classification reaching up to 53 m/s. Alerts were raised to the highest level for the first time in five years, leading to flight cancellations and production suspensions in affected regions[11][9]. Decision-makers, including military leaders, relied heavily on accurate forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to implement protective measures, significantly minimizing potential damage[8][12].

# Comparisons

## Typhoon Hinnamnor and Typhoon Haiyan

Typhoon Hinnamnor, which occurred in 2022, is often compared to Typhoon Haiyan due to its severity and destructive impact. Typhoon Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, was one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, reaching Category 5 status with wind speeds exceeding 157 mph (252 km/h)[13]. In contrast, Typhoon Hinnamnor, classified as a super typhoon, also demonstrated immense power, leading to catastrophic flooding and significant damage across the Republic of Korea and other Northwest Pacific regions[2][13].
Both typhoons were categorized as super typhoons, the highest classification indicating maximum wind speeds greater than 51.0 m/s (approximately 115 mph)[2]. However, while Haiyan caused a devastating humanitarian crisis in the Philippines in 2013, resulting in over 6,000 fatalities, Hinnamnor's impact was felt more broadly across coastal cities in Korea, where it inundated areas and destroyed infrastructure[14][13].

## Climate Change Impacts

The intensity and frequency of super typhoons, including Hinnamnor and Haiyan, have been linked to climate change. Warmer sea surface temperatures, driven by anthropogenic climate change, are believed to provide favorable conditions for the development of more powerful tropical cyclones[15][14]. Researchers have noted that higher atmospheric moisture levels contribute to increased precipitation rates associated with these storms, which exacerbates flooding risks during their landfalls[15][14]. This connection has prompted discussions about the changing nature of typhoons in the context of a warming planet, suggesting that storms like Hinnamnor may become more common in the future[14].

## Frequency and Trends

According to recent studies, there is evidence suggesting an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones in key regions due to climate change[15]. The destructive power of storms like Hinnamnor and Haiyan highlights the importance of ongoing research and improved models to predict future cyclone behavior under changing climatic conditions[15]. Enhanced monitoring and data collection, including the work of organizations like NOAA, are crucial for understanding trends and improving disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions[16][15].
