Unlike the more widely recognized tea cultures of China and Japan, Korean tea rituals prioritize harmony, respect, and mindfulness, transforming each tea session into a serene journey[2][4]. The introduction of tea to Korea dates back to the 7th century, brought primarily by Buddhist monks who appreciated its calming properties.

# History

O'Sulloc Tea's origins can be traced back to 1979, when Suh Sung-whan, the former president of Amorepacific, began cultivating wasteland on Jeju Island into a tea field. This initiative marked the revival of tea production in Korea, where tea had long been appreciated for its cultural significance and meditative qualities, particularly during the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties. During this time, tea was not only a popular beverage but also a form of tribute sent to the Chinese court, symbolizing its importance in reinforcing diplomatic ties between Korea and China[2][3][5][6].
The introduction of tea to Korea occurred around the 7th century, primarily through Buddhist monks who recognized its calming properties. As tea culture developed, it became deeply intertwined with Korean spirituality, emphasizing harmony, respect, and mindfulness during tea rituals. These aspects are reflected in the simplicity and naturalism of Korean tea ceremonies established during the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties[3][6][16].
In the context of O'Sulloc, the brand's founding not only revitalized the local tea industry but also highlighted the unique qualities of Korean teas. The Hadong region, known for its high mountains and mineral-rich waters, is recognized as the birthplace of Korean green tea, producing varieties celebrated for their subtle sweetness and fresh notes[6][16][17]. Through O'Sulloc, this rich heritage of Korean tea is preserved and promoted, bridging historical significance with modern tea culture.

# Cultivation

## Overview

O'Sulloc Tea, a prominent tea producer on Jeju Island, employs advanced organic farming methods to cultivate high-quality tea leaves. The company has gained recognition for its environmentally friendly practices, which benefit both consumers and the ecosystem[3][34].

## Historical Background

The inception of the O'Sulloc green tea farm can be traced back to 1979 when it was established on a rocky volcanic field. The founder, Jangwon Seo Seong-wan, aimed to revive the declining Korean tea tradition by launching a project to cultivate a tea field named Dolsongi[35][20]. Over the years, O'Sulloc has expanded its tea plantations, particularly on the slopes of Halla Mountain, where it began cultivating the Dosun tea fields in 1980[1][36].

## Cultivation Process

All tea produced by O'Sulloc is planted, maintained, harvested, and collected using machines, which allows for efficiency and consistency in the cultivation process[13]. The total cultivation area spans approximately 330 hectares, with about 180 hectares designated for harvesting[1][36]. The meticulous care in the cultivation process includes light primary processing and secondary processing stages, such as roasting and blending, ensuring the quality of the final product[37].
O'Sulloc's tea is typically harvested during the early spring and summer seasons. The leaves are carefully picked, often selecting two young leaves and a terminal bud from the Camellia sinensis bushes. While mechanical harvesting is common, hand-picking is preferred for higher quality tea, which allows for more selective and precise collection[38][39].
The unique soil composition of Jeju Island, influenced by its volcanic origins, contributes to the distinct flavor profile of O'Sulloc teas, making them a sought-after choice in the global market[40][34].

# Tourism

The O'sulloc Tea Museum, located in Jeju-do, has become a prominent tourist attraction since its opening in September 2001, drawing an average of 700,000 visitors annually[9][41][15]. The museum aims to rejuvenate interest in Korean tea history and culture, providing visitors with an immersive experience that includes displays of traditional tea wares and utensils from the Three Kingdoms period. Exhibitions within the museum detail the evolution of tea drinking in Korea over the years, complemented by galleries showcasing ceramic tea cups from various countries, including Japan, China, and European nations[42][43].

Notably, the building is designed to resemble a teacup from above, further emphasizing its thematic connection to tea[15][42].
In addition to the museum, the nearby Tea Stone facility, established in 2013, provides educational classes on tea brewing, allowing visitors to deepen their appreciation for tea culture. These sessions require advance online registration and accommodate small groups of up to 20 participants at a time[44][45].

These certifications highlight O'Sulloc's dedication to producing high-quality green tea while minimizing environmental impact.
The Sulloc Tea Research Institute, established in 2005 near the Jeju tea fields, plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of green tea through sustainable agricultural practices. The institute focuses on researching and implementing methods that contribute to both productivity and environmental stewardship[46][47]. This includes exploring the benefits of specific soil types and cultivation techniques that promote healthy tea growth without compromising ecological integrity[25][13].
In addition to organic practices, O'Sulloc's tea production is guided by the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles, making it the first in the sector to achieve this certification in 2002[12]. The adherence to HACCP standards ensures that O'Sulloc maintains high safety and quality standards throughout the production process, further underscoring its commitment to responsible farming.
O'Sulloc also engages in community outreach and education, promoting awareness about the importance of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation among visitors to its tea fields and museum.
