Hurricane Hilary, a formidable Pacific hurricane in August 2023, had significant impacts on Western Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States. As the eighth named storm and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Hilary's rapid development and extensive reach resulted in widespread flooding, mudslides, and notable infrastructural damage across multiple regions.

**Meteorological Development and Path**

Hilary's origins trace back to a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa around August 3, 2023. This wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Lesser Antilles by August 9. After crossing Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 12, a low-pressure area developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec by August 14. The system gradually organized, leading to the formation of a tropical depression on August 16, approximately 345 miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. By August 17, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, earning the name Hilary.

Environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and low wind shear, facilitated rapid intensification. Hilary achieved hurricane status on August 17 and continued strengthening, reaching Category 4 status with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and a central pressure of 940 mbar by August 18. The hurricane's expansive structure featured tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles from its center. Subsequently, Hilary underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, leading to slight weakening. However, it briefly re-intensified before encountering cooler waters and increased wind shear, causing a steady decline in strength. Hilary made landfall as a tropical storm on August 20 in San Quintín, Baja California, with sustained winds of 60 mph, before degenerating into a post-tropical cyclone over land.

**Impact on Mexico**

In Mexico, Hurricane Hilary prompted extensive preparations, including evacuations and port closures along the coast. The hurricane resulted in three fatalities and caused damage estimated at 854 million pesos (approximately US$48 million). Power outages affected over 315,000 individuals, though most services were restored within four days. The storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides, and downed trees, particularly impacting the Baja California Peninsula.

**Impact on the United States**

In anticipation of "catastrophic and life-threatening flooding," the National Hurricane Center issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico-United States border to areas just north of Los Angeles. The storm brought record-breaking rainfall to parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah, with some regions receiving up to 600% of their average August rainfall. This unprecedented precipitation led to widespread flooding, mudslides, and infrastructural damage. In California's San Bernardino County, one person lost their life due to the floods. The estimated damage in the United States totaled approximately US$900 million, with significant impacts in Inyo County, California, where most roads in Death Valley National Park were damaged, leading to a two-month closure—the longest in the park's history.

**Long-Term Effects**

The heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Hilary had lasting geological impacts. In the Palos Verdes Peninsula, south of Los Angeles, increased landslide activity was observed, accelerating due to the saturated ground conditions. By February 2025, the region experienced land movement at a rate of four inches per week, endangering hundreds of structures and leading to declarations of emergency and property buyout programs.

**Conclusion**

Hurricane Hilary of 2023 serves as a stark reminder of the potential severity of Pacific hurricanes and their far-reaching impacts. The storm's rapid intensification and extensive rainfall led to significant challenges across multiple regions, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and resilient infrastructure in mitigating the effects of such natural disasters.
