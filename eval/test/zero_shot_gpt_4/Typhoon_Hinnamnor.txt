Typhoon Hinnamnor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Henry, was a significant and powerful tropical cyclone that impacted several East Asian countries in early September 2022. As the eleventh named storm, fourth typhoon, and first super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor's development, trajectory, and impact offer valuable insights into the behavior of such natural phenomena.

**Meteorological Development and Path**

The origins of Typhoon Hinnamnor can be traced back to a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27, 2022, by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). This area soon formed into Tropical Storm Hinnamnor on the next day. The storm rapidly intensified and became a typhoon on August 29. Overnight, Hinnamnor developed a small eye along with a well-defined central dense overcast (CDO), and intensified into a high-end Category 4-equivalent super typhoon.

Hinnamnor then weakened due to undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. However, it re-intensified to a Category 5 super typhoon, the first of 2022, with a larger eye and CDO south of Okinawa. An increasingly hostile environment caused it to lose its convective features the night of September 1, weakening it down to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. As the storm accelerated northward into the East China Sea, it rebuilt itself throughout the next day and began intensifying again. The storm gained major status once again on September 4 and headed northeastwards towards Busan. Beginning to weaken for the final time on September 5, the storm made landfall late that day as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and began extratropical transition.

**Impact on Affected Regions**

*Japan and Okinawa*: As Hinnamnor approached, many advisories concerning the storm were issued in Japan. The typhoon brought flooding rainfall and powerful winds to Okinawa, and thousands of homes suffered power outages.

*Taiwan*: Heavy rainfall affected northern districts in Taiwan.

*Philippines*: A man died in the Philippines due to Hinnamnor's flooding.

*South Korea*: Hinnamnor made landfall just southeast of Geoje in South Korea, knocking out power for tens of thousands of homes.

*Russian Far East*: The storm's remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to parts of the Russian Far East, leading to localized flooding and infrastructure damage.

**Casualties and Damages**

Overall, Typhoon Hinnamnor was responsible for 20 deaths, 1 missing, and US$1.81 billion in damage across several countries.

**Retirement of the Name 'Hinnamnor'**

Due to the extensive damage in South Korea, the Typhoon Committee announced that the name Hinnamnor, along with five others, would be removed from the naming lists despite its first usage. In the spring of 2024, the name was replaced with Ong-mang, which refers to the Eld's Deer (Rucervus eldii) or brow-antlered deer.

**Conclusion**

Typhoon Hinnamnor's rapid intensification, expansive reach, and the widespread impact it had across multiple countries underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and preparedness in the face of natural disasters. The storm's legacy serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of tropical cyclones and the necessity for robust infrastructure and responsive disaster management strategies in vulnerable regions.
