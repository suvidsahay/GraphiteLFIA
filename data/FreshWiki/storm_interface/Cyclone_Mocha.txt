# summary

**Cyclone Mocha** was a powerful and devastating Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) that formed in the Bay of Bengal in May 2023, primarily impacting the coastal regions of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Originating from a low-pressure system on May 9, the cyclone rapidly intensified and made landfall on May 14, with sustained winds reaching up to 130 mph (approximately 209 km/h). It is regarded as one of the most destructive storms to affect these areas in recent history, resulting in extensive loss of life, massive displacement of populations, and severe damage to infrastructure and agriculture.[1][2][3][4].
The storm's impact was particularly severe in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, where hundreds of fatalities were reported, alongside the destruction of thousands of homes, many of which housed Rohingya refugees.[2][5] In Myanmar, Rakhine State bore the brunt of the storm, affecting over 1.2 million people and leading to significant agricultural losses. The ongoing conflict in Myanmar complicated rescue and relief operations, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.[4][6][7]. 
Communication challenges hindered damage assessments and response efforts in both countries, leaving many areas isolated in the aftermath of the cyclone. In response, international aid organizations mobilized to provide emergency assistance, but obstacles such as damaged infrastructure and logistical difficulties complicated these efforts.[8][9][10]. As climate change continues to increase the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the region, Cyclone Mocha highlights the urgent need for improved disaster preparedness and response strategies to mitigate the impacts of such catastrophic events in the future.[11][12].

# Meteorological Description

## Genesis and Development

Cyclone Mocha, officially classified as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS), originated from a low-pressure system that formed on May 9, 2023, over the lower latitudes of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) [1]. The cyclone exhibited a typical life cycle, initially moving southeast before shifting to a north-northwest trajectory at a speed of approximately 8 km/h by May 11, 2023 [2]. By this time, it was situated near latitude 11.4°N and longitude 88.0°E, about 510 km west-southwest of Port Blair and 1100 km south-southwest of Sittwe, Myanmar [13].
As per the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm's trajectory was influenced by western disturbances prevalent over northwest India [1]. On May 12, the cyclone began to recurve and was expected to intensify further, reaching its peak intensity around May 13 [2].

## Rapid Intensification

The IMD defined rapid intensification (RI) for Tropical Cyclone Mocha based on criteria that require a persistent maximum sustained wind of at least 30 knots within a 24-hour period [14]. An analysis of the storm from 2004 to 2023 indicated that the month of May typically sees the highest rates of RI compared to other months [1]. The observed lowest central pressure (CSLP) recorded during Mocha's life cycle was approximately 938 hPa, with maximum sustained winds (MSW) reaching about 110 knots by May 14, 2023 [15].
The conditions favorable for RI included high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of around 31 degrees Celsius, substantial low-level relative humidity of approximately 79%, and significant vertical wind shear [16][17]. These parameters are critical in the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones [18]. The cyclone was characterized by organized convective cloud clusters around a central low-pressure area, essential for its development [19].

## Synoptic Features

The synoptic analysis of Cyclone Mocha highlighted the role of various meteorological elements, including low-level convergence and upper-level divergence, which contributed to its strengthening [20]. The favorable environment for cyclogenesis during this pre-monsoon season in the BoB indicates a complex interaction between the cyclone and surrounding weather patterns, such as the presence of extra-tropical troughs and ridges [16]. This interaction is crucial as it influences the storm's movement and intensity [17].

# Impact

Cyclone Mocha, which made landfall on May 14, 2023, has been characterized as one of the worst tropical storms to affect the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar in recent years. With sustained winds reaching up to 130 mph, the cyclone has caused extensive environmental damage, infrastructure destruction, and significant displacement of populations in the affected regions[3][2].

## Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, the cyclone struck particularly hard in the Cox’s Bazar district, where refugee communities felt the brunt of its impact. Reports indicate that hundreds of people have died, with many thousands more displaced due to the destruction of homes and infrastructure[2][5]. Initial assessments from government officials noted that approximately 2,000 homes were destroyed and an additional 10,000 were damaged in areas such as Saint Martin’s Island and Teknaf[5]. The Bangladesh government and international aid agencies, including Self Help Africa, have mobilized resources to assist affected communities, especially in the densely populated refugee camps housing Rohingya Muslims who fled persecution in Myanmar[2][21].

## Myanmar

The cyclone also had devastating effects in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine State, where over 1.2 million people across seven districts and 17 townships were impacted[4][6]. The storm led to significant damages in five regions, namely Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway, Mandalay, and Chin, with Rakhine being the worst affected[22][17]. The ongoing conflict in these regions has complicated response efforts, exacerbating the cyclone's impact on local populations[6]. Estimates suggest that agricultural losses in Rakhine amounted to almost 30% of its total capital stock, illustrating the severe economic repercussions of the disaster[4].

## Communication Challenges

Efforts to assess the damage in both Bangladesh and Myanmar have been hindered by major obstructions to communications, making it difficult to provide timely and accurate reports on the extent of the destruction[23][24]. The combination of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and the geographical vulnerability of the region has led to fears of further suffering and potential fatalities in the aftermath of the cyclone[7]. As evacuations continue, humanitarian organizations are striving to mitigate the impact and support those affected by the disaster[8][9].

# Response and Recovery

## Immediate Response

In the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha, significant relief efforts have been mobilized across affected regions, particularly in Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) has been at the forefront, providing essential items such as food, drinking water, and emergency relief supplies to affected households[11][25]. In addition to distributing aid, MRCS has facilitated the mass evacuation of over 1.2 million individuals, demonstrating a rapid response to the crisis[25]. Initial assessments conducted by various organizations, including the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), estimated that approximately 16 million people were affected by the cyclone, including 5 million children[13][8].
Local partners and international organizations, such as the Singapore Red Cross, have also been activated to assist with humanitarian needs, with responders on standby for further deployment[26][27].

## Challenges to Relief Efforts

Despite the prompt response, several challenges have hampered effective relief operations. Major obstructions to communications have hindered timely damage assessments, complicating the situation for emergency responders[16][10]. The destruction of key infrastructure, including shelters and water points, particularly in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, has further complicated the efforts to deliver aid[1].

## Ongoing Recovery Efforts

As recovery operations continue, organizations are prioritizing the immediate needs of affected communities while also planning for long-term rehabilitation. The MRCS has activated its Emergency Operations Centre at various levels to coordinate the response effectively[26][28]. With over 700 volunteers mobilized, the focus remains on providing comprehensive assistance to those impacted by the cyclone's destructive path[29].
The ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) has been instrumental in coordinating response efforts, collaborating closely with OCHA and local agencies to monitor the evolving situation and prepare necessary relief supplies[13][8].

# Historical Context

In May 2023, Cyclone Mocha formed as a powerful and deadly storm in the North Indian Ocean, reaching wind intensities equivalent to Category 5 hurricanes. The storm primarily impacted Myanmar, along with neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India[30][31]. The cyclone's formation was closely monitored by the AHA Centre, which activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to a Yellow alert level, indicating increased vigilance. Coordination efforts were initiated with Myanmar's Department of Disaster Management (DDM), and relevant information was disseminated to stakeholders through Flash Updates and Hazard Briefs[32][33].
Historical data indicates significant fluctuations in cyclone formations over the past few decades. Between 1991 and 2000, there was a noted decrease in the number of tropical depressions, while the occurrence of severe cyclones increased. Furthermore, the intensity of landfalling cyclones has risen, with severe cyclonic storms escalating to very severe cyclonic storms (VSCSs) within 24 hours before landfall. The frequency of such intense storms tripled in the decade from 2011 to 2020 compared to the previous decade[34][35]. This increase in cyclone intensity and frequency is attributed to enhanced conditions for cyclone formation, including warmer sea surface temperatures (SST) and higher moisture levels in the atmosphere[11][36].
Efforts to prepare for and respond to cyclones have also evolved. Organizations like Self Help Africa have implemented Cyclone Preparedness and Early Action Plans in cyclone-prone regions. These initiatives have proven beneficial during events like Cyclone Mocha, where community-level planning included delivering weather forecasts and advising on preemptive actions such as harvesting crops to minimize damage from the impending storm[34][35]. As climate change continues to influence weather patterns, the challenges posed by cyclones are likely to persist, necessitating ongoing adaptation and preparedness efforts[12].
