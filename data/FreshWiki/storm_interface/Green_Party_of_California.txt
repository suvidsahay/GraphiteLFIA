# summary

The Green Party of California (GPCA) is a political organization dedicated to promoting ecological sustainability, social justice, and grassroots democracy within California. As a state-level affiliate of the national Green Party, the GPCA emerged from the global Green movement in the late 20th century, formally organizing in the mid-1990s. The party is notable for its advocacy on critical issues such as climate change, electoral reform, and social equity, positioning itself as a progressive alternative to California's dominant Democratic Party. 
Historically, the GPCA has played a significant role in environmental activism, leveraging California's leadership in climate policy to push for ambitious legislative goals. The state has seen progressive policies like ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets and renewable energy initiatives, with the Green Party actively participating in these discussions and advocating for stronger action. The GPCAâ€™s electoral strategies have allowed it to secure local government positions, although challenges persist, particularly in navigating the state's \"top-two\" primary system and advancing candidates at higher levels.[1][2].
The party has faced various controversies, including allegations of election irregularities and internal tensions regarding environmental policies that sometimes conflict with local economic interests dependent on fossil fuels. Furthermore, connections to foreign influence in the 2016 presidential campaign have raised questions about the party's political integrity and public perception.[3][4]. Despite these challenges, the GPCA remains committed to its foundational values, seeking to unite left-leaning factions in California while addressing the pressing socio-environmental issues of our time.

# History

## Formation and Early Development

The Green Party of California has its roots in the broader Green movement that began to take shape in the late 20th century. The initial organizational efforts can be traced back to the first Green presidential campaign in 1996 when 62 Greens from 30 states convened in Middleburg, Virginia, to establish the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP) and create a structured national Green Party[1]. This period marked a significant shift in the Green movement, emphasizing the need for a legally recognized and organized political structure to advance Green values and policies.
The first formal announcement of the Green Party of the USA occurred during the Green Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, in August 1991, where the Green Committees of Correspondence were restructured to operate as part of a unified organization[1]. The formation of the ASGP in 1996 laid the groundwork for state-level Green parties, including California's[1].

## California's Environmental Leadership

California has emerged as a leader in environmental initiatives, shaped significantly by the policies of its governors over the decades. The state's commitment to addressing climate change intensified under the leadership of notable figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown. Schwarzenegger introduced the nation's pioneering law mandating greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, which established tailpipe emissions regulations that set a national standard[5]. Under Brown, initiatives such as the \"Million Solar Roofs\" program further bolstered California's renewable energy sector, reducing the costs of solar power significantly[6].
In September 2023, Governor Gavin Newsom represented California at the Climate Ambition Summit in New York, highlighting the state's dedication to a carbon-free future and calling for decisive action from the oil industry in light of recent climate-related challenges faced by the state[5]. This ongoing commitment to innovative environmental policies has reinforced California's reputation as a vanguard of climate action.

## Strategic Alliances and Advocacy

The Green Party of California has actively engaged in various environmental and social justice campaigns, seeking to unite left-leaning factions within the state. In October 2021, the party endorsed a Left Unity Slate alongside the Peace and Freedom Party for the 2022 elections, reflecting its strategic approach to coalition-building[2]. Additionally, the party has worked to mobilize support against legislative measures perceived as detrimental to its goals, such as Proposition 14, which aimed to alter California's primary voting system[2].
Through these alliances and advocacy efforts, the Green Party of California continues to navigate the complex landscape of state politics while remaining committed to its foundational values of ecological sustainability, social justice, and grassroots democracy.

# Organizational Structure

## General Assembly

The highest decision-making body of the Green Party of California (GPCA) is the bi-annual General Assembly, which consists of delegates from active county Green Parties. The number of delegates allocated to each county is roughly proportional to the number of Green registrants in that county. Key responsibilities of the General Assembly include approving the party platform and budget, confirming the state party Treasurer and governmental Liaison to the Secretary of State, and deciding on candidates for the Green presidential primary ballot. Additionally, there is an online version known as the Standing General Assembly, which meets online approximately three times a year and makes decisions via a web-based voting platform[7][8].

## Coordinating Committee

In the intervals between General Assemblies, a 24-member state Coordinating Committee oversees the ongoing work of the party. This committee coordinates state meetings and maintains internal communications. Members are elected by the Standing General Assembly, with a focus on proportional representation through ranked-choice voting. Each year, six female and six any-gender members are elected to staggered two-year terms. Standing Committees, appointed by the Coordinating Committee, focus on specific areas and develop proposals for the General Assembly. Committees hold regular monthly meetings, and Coordinating Committee members serve as liaisons to ensure effective communication[7][9].

## Officers and Roles

The GPCA does not utilize traditional co-chairs; instead, a team of officers performs specific roles statewide. Key positions include the Liaison to the Secretary of State, who represents the GPCA to the Secretary of State's office, and the Treasurer, who manages standard treasury functions. Both positions are nominated by the Coordinating Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly. Additionally, Spokespeople represent the GPCA to the media and the public, while Co-Coordinators oversee the administration of committees, being selected by the committees themselves[7][8].

## County Councils

Each active county within the GPCA elects members to the local County Council, which serves as the official legal body of the party at the local level. County Councils are responsible for ensuring compliance with state and local election laws, organizing Green Party activities within the county, and conducting regular public meetings. Local Green Party groups, referred to as \"locals,\" are permitted to establish their own bylaws to define their decision-making processes[9].

# Political Platform

The Green Party of California (GPCA) advocates for a transformation of the electoral system from the traditional winner-take-all model to proportional representation (PR). This change aims to enhance voter choice, reduce the dominance of the two-party system, and address the under-representation of women and minorities in government.[10] The party supports the implementation of PR at all levels of government and seeks to establish commissions to explore alternative electoral systems, with the goal of informing the public about these options.[10]
One of the core principles of the GPCA is the establishment of practical experience with PR within local organizations, such as neighborhood councils and non-profit boards, alongside conducting policy-based preferenda to better gauge public sentiment on various issues. The party also advocates for ranked-choice voting in internal elections, allowing for a more democratic selection process.[10]
The Green Party's foundational Ten Key Values, established in the mid-1980s, serve as guiding principles for its political platform. These values encompass ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy, and non-violence, and they underscore the party's commitment to building a more equitable and participatory political system.[11] The importance of these values was highlighted during the Second National Green Gathering in 1989, where a strong emphasis was placed on initiating local electoral campaigns before scaling up to state and national levels.[11]
In recent years, the GPCA has also focused on issues such as climate change, advocating for aggressive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels. The party criticizes policies that are perceived as slow or inadequate in addressing environmental concerns, reflecting a broader commitment to ecological justice and sustainability within its political platform.[1]

# Elections

## Overview of Election Participation

The Green Party of California (GPCA) has participated in various electoral cycles since its establishment. After the implementation of Proposition 14, which altered the election code, the party faced challenges in advancing candidates through the newly established \"top-two\" primary system. Following three election cycles without any Green candidates progressing, the 2018 US House elections marked a turning point, where several Green candidates successfully advanced to the general elections[2][12].

## Notable Election Results

### 2018 US House Elections

In the 2018 US House elections, three Green Party candidates made significant strides:
- **Laura Wells** ran in House district CA-13, advanced from a six-candidate primary, and garnered 34,257 votes in the general election, representing 11.6% of the total[12].
- **Kenneth Mejia** competed in House district CA-34, advancing from a three-candidate primary and receiving 41,711 votes in the general election, accounting for 27.5% of the vote[2][12].
- **Rodolfo Cortes-Barragan** ran in House district CA-40, also advancing from the primary and achieving 27,511 votes in the general election, which was 22.7%[2].
Each candidate faced incumbents from the California Democratic Party (CDP) in their respective districts, illustrating the growing presence and electoral viability of Green candidates in California.

## Presidential Elections

In the GPCA primary of the 1996 presidential election, **Ralph Nader** went unopposed, although he did not receive the Greens/Green Party USA nomination. Nonetheless, during the California general election, Nader received a substantial 237,016 votes, reflecting early voter support for Green ideologies[2].

## Current Elected Officials

As of January 2022, the Green Party holds positions in local governments across California. This includes two elected mayors and three members serving on municipal councils.

### Mayoral Offices

- **Emmanuel Estrada** in Baldwin Park
- **Bruce Delgado** in Marina

### Municipal Councils

- **Sylvia Chavez** in Calipatria
- **Stephen Zollman** in Sebastopol
- **Quincy McCourt** in Susanville
This representation underscores the party's increasing influence at local levels and its commitment to promoting its platform within California's political landscape[2][12].

# Activism and Advocacy

## Overview

The Green Party of California has been active in various forms of social and political advocacy, focusing on environmental issues, social justice, and grassroots mobilization. The movement has evolved significantly since its early gatherings, notably the Second National Green Gathering in Eugene, Oregon, held from June 21â€“25, 1989, which aimed to consolidate Green policies and strategies for electoral engagement[11][1].

## Educational Initiatives

The Green Party's commitment to education is evident from the inception of the Committees of Correspondence (CoC), which emphasized gathering Greens and activists from related movements to share knowledge and perspectives rather than making top-down decisions[11]. This inclusive approach fostered a spirit of collaboration and learning, critical for grassroots activism.

## Strategic Policy Approaches in Key Areas (SPAKA)

In the late 1980s, the party initiated the Strategic Policy Approaches in Key Areas (SPAKA) process to develop a coherent set of policies reflecting its core values. This participatory effort involved gathering input from Green locals and like-minded organizations, resulting in 190 position papers that were reclassified into 19 key issue areas, including energy, social justice, and eco-philosophy[11][1]. This process not only helped in formulating a Green platform but also solidified the party's identity and collective mission.

## Electoral Strategies

A significant aspect of the Eugene Gathering was the focus on electoral strategies, which included workshops aimed at forming a Green Party of the West. This initiative served as a precursor to more organized electoral campaigns and the eventual establishment of the Green Party of California[11]. The emphasis on local-level engagement set the foundation for broader electoral ambitions, with a recommendation for Greens to start running candidates at local levels before advancing to state and national levels[11].

## Key Figures and Events

Prominent speakers at the gatherings included influential activists such as Grace Lee Boggs and Murray Bookchin, who highlighted the need for a multi-faceted approach to Green activism[11][1]. These events also showcased a variety of workshops addressing key themes like Independent Political Action, reflecting the party's commitment to both educational and electoral activism. The discussions around 'party vs. movement' and other tensions within the Green community further underscored the complexity of building a unified front in advocacy efforts[11][1].
Through these initiatives and dialogues, the Green Party of California has consistently aimed to empower its members and advocate for systemic change, striving to engage communities in sustainable and equitable practices.

# Environmental Policies and Initiatives

## Overview

The Green Party of California has been at the forefront of advocating for robust environmental policies aimed at combating climate change and promoting sustainability. The party's initiatives reflect a commitment to transitioning away from fossil fuels, enhancing renewable energy sources, and addressing urgent environmental challenges faced by the state.

## Recent Legislative Actions

In recent years, California has made significant strides in climate policy. As part of the landmark global agreement reached at COP28 in Dubai, California is channeling substantial investments into renewable energy initiatives, such as electric vehicles and offshore wind power. This investment aligns with the state's goal of achieving 100% clean energy. In a notable legislative session, five out of six climate and energy bills proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom were approved and signed into law. These laws set interim targets for clean energy and regulate carbon removal projects, while also imposing restrictions on new oil drilling near communities[5][13].
One of the key initiatives was the adoption of advanced rules by the California Water Resources Control Board, allowing the conversion of sewage into drinking water to address water scarcity exacerbated by climate change. This innovative approach is part of California's broader strategy to improve water quality and sustainability amidst challenging climatic conditions[5].

## Public Support and Challenges

Public sentiment in California largely favors aggressive action against climate change. A survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California indicated that three out of four residents believe immediate action is necessary to combat climate-related issues[5]. Despite this consensus, there is variability in personal willingness to adopt changes, particularly regarding emission reduction policies.
However, not all proposed legislation has passed smoothly. For instance, a bill aimed at ramping up greenhouse gas reduction goals (AB 2133) was ultimately rejected by the Assembly, highlighting the ongoing challenges the Green Party faces in advancing its environmental agenda[13].

## Nature-Based Solutions

In the context of addressing greenhouse gas emissions, California has also emphasized nature-based solutions. For instance, the recently signed AB 1757 requires the state to establish targets for carbon removal through natural methods, such as reforestation and wetland restoration. This approach has garnered support from environmentalists who argue that leveraging natural systems is crucial for effective climate action[13][14].

# Controversies and Criticism

## Allegations of Election Irregularities

The Green Party of California has faced scrutiny regarding allegations of irregularities in its primary elections. This criticism has been particularly pronounced during high-stakes election cycles, with opponents suggesting that the party's processes may lack transparency or fairness. Reports from various media outlets highlighted concerns raised by party members and external observers alike about the integrity of the electoral process within the party, especially in the context of the broader political landscape where minor parties often face challenges in gaining legitimacy and recognition[3][2].

## Tensions Over Environmental Policy

The party's position on environmental policies has sometimes led to tensions within the state. California, known for its environmental activism, also plays a significant role as a major oil producer. This contradiction has become a focal point of criticism directed at the Green Party, particularly in light of the state's ambitious goals for carbon neutrality by 2045 and its controversial ban on new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Critics argue that the Green Party's policies may not adequately address the economic realities faced by communities dependent on fossil fuel industries, thereby creating a disconnect between environmental goals and local economic interests[4].

## Connections to Russian Influence

The Green Party has also been implicated in controversies related to foreign influence, particularly regarding its 2016 presidential candidate, Jill Stein. Stein's positions on Russia, particularly in relation to the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine, have drawn criticism for appearing to align with Russian government narratives. Additionally, investigations into the 2016 election indicated that Russian operatives launched social media campaigns to bolster Stein's candidacy, further complicating the party's political standing and raising questions about its susceptibility to external manipulation[3][2].
These controversies continue to affect the public perception of the Green Party of California, as it navigates its role in a rapidly changing political environment while striving to maintain its core principles of environmentalism and social justice.
