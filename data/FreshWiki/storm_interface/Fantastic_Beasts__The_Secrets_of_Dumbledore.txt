# Production

## Filming Schedule and Location

Principal photography for \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" was initially set to commence on 16 March 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Filming officially began in London on 20 September 2020, with strict safety precautions in place to protect the cast and crew from the virus.[1] The production experienced a temporary halt on 3 February 2021 when a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. Ultimately, composer James Newton Howard confirmed that filming had wrapped later that month.[1] Although parts of the film are set in Berlin and Bhutan, these locations were not filmed on-site. Instead, they were reimagined and constructed on the expansive backlot and sound stages of Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, enhanced by visual effects supervised by Christian Manz.[1]

## Cinematic Color Design

Cinematic color design plays a pivotal role in shaping the film's visual narrative. Cinematographers collaborate closely with lighting directors to ensure that the colors captured on camera effectively convey the intended mood and atmosphere. This collaborative effort extends to production designers and costume designers, who select colors that complement the film’s overall visual tone. Make-up artists further enhance this synergy by aligning the characters' appearances with the established color scheme, thereby enhancing the authenticity and impact of their portrayals.[2][3][4].
Concept artists Jack Dudman, Eva Kuntz, and Dermot Power contributed illustrations that served as foundational elements for the film's visual style, working alongside production designers Neil Lamont and Stuart Craig.[3][5] The process included camera tests arranged by cinematographer Richard Richmond to facilitate communication among the production departments. Richmond conducted tests involving camera setups and varying lighting conditions to assess how different looks interacted with the set and costumes.[3][5][6] This method allowed the team to evaluate how lighting could affect color contrast and overall visual beauty, ensuring that each scene's emotional tone was effectively captured.[7][8].

## Technical Aspects

The cinematography utilized lenses that provided a distinct emotional feel to the shots. Richmond primarily shot using 40mm, 50mm, and 75mm lenses, operating most of the camera work himself. He emphasized the need for an immersive filming style, stating that the LF anamorphic system requires the camera to be integrated into the action, allowing for dynamic interaction with the actors.[9] This hands-on approach, combined with the collaboration across various departments, underscored the film's commitment to creating a rich visual tapestry that enhances storytelling through color and light.

# Plot

In \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,\" the narrative continues to delve into the intricate politics surrounding Gellert Grindelwald while reintroducing magical beasts as central elements of the storyline. The film aims to correct criticisms from its predecessor, \"Crimes of Grindelwald,\" which was noted for its underutilization of these fantastical creatures[10][11]. The introduction of the Qilin, a mythical beast with a unique design, plays a crucial role in the plot, serving as a key figure in wizarding elections and reminding audiences of the charm that made the first film successful[12][13].
The storyline intricately weaves together the personal secrets of characters, particularly focusing on the relationships among Newt Scamander, his friends, and family[14]. Despite the packed narrative, the film also struggles with character development; while Jacob Kowalski remains a fan-favorite, other characters, such as Queenie Goldstein and Theseus Scamander, seem to stagnate in their arcs[6][15]. Additionally, the return of characters like Tina Goldstein is minimal, leading to some dissatisfaction regarding their roles in the overarching plot[16][6].
The film not only expands on the mythology of its magical beasts but also introduces new characters, such as Lally Hicks, whose necessity in the storyline has been questioned[15]. The complexity of the plot intertwines the past and present of key characters, including the revelation of Credence's true lineage as Aurelius Dumbledore, which opens new avenues for character exploration[6]. Overall, \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" attempts to balance its intricate plotlines while addressing previous criticisms, ultimately providing a blend of politics, magical creatures, and character development.

# Reception

\"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" received a mixed response from both critics and audiences upon its release. Critics highlighted aspects such as the film's visual effects and performances, particularly praising Jude Law's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore and Mads Mikkelsen's take on Gellert Grindelwald[17][18]. However, many reviewers pointed out issues with the plot's coherence and pacing, suggesting that the narrative felt convoluted and at times disjointed, which detracted from the overall viewing experience[9].
Box office performance also reflected the divided reception. The film debuted to a modest opening weekend, grossing approximately $57 million domestically, which was seen as underwhelming compared to previous entries in the franchise[19][20]. Despite the lackluster performance, the film did find some success internationally, contributing to a global total that was better received[21][22].
Viewer feedback was similarly polarized. While some fans of the Harry Potter universe appreciated the expansion of its lore and character development, others expressed disappointment with the film's direction and pacing. This split in audience reception highlighted the challenges faced by the franchise in appealing to both die-hard fans and new viewers[23][24].

# Impact

The \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" has elicited a mixed response from audiences and critics alike, reflecting the complexities surrounding its production and release. While the series is recognized for its significant cultural relevance, especially among dedicated fans of the Wizarding World, it has also faced considerable challenges. This installment, along with its predecessors, has been marked by controversies, including public scrutiny surrounding actor Ezra Miller, which have contributed to the franchise's perceived instability[25][26].
Despite these challenges, the film holds a notable place in the hearts of many fans, serving as a vehicle for nostalgia and connection to the beloved Harry Potter universe. Critics have pointed out that the film possesses certain strengths, including engaging action sequences and character development, albeit alongside criticisms of its overall coherence and execution[27][1]. The narrative's ability to transport viewers back to a cherished world is acknowledged, emphasizing the film's importance to various communities, even as it struggles to maintain widespread appeal[28][29].
Furthermore, the psychological impact of color and cinematography in \"The Secrets of Dumbledore\" plays a critical role in shaping audience perceptions and emotional experiences. Color psychology suggests that different hues can elicit specific emotional responses, enhancing the film's storytelling and character arcs[3][30]. As the franchise navigates its current trajectory, the application of emerging technologies in film, such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, signifies a forward-looking approach to visual storytelling, even as the series grapples with its legacy and future prospects[31].

# Historical Context

\"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" is set against the backdrop of the 1930s, a period marked by significant global political tensions and the lead-up to World War II. This historical setting is integral to the film's narrative, as it explores the magical world's involvement in the escalating conflicts of the time, particularly as they relate to the rise of dark forces within the wizarding community[1][32]. The storyline takes viewers on a journey from iconic locations like Hogwarts to various international destinations, including Brazil, Bhutan, Germany, and China, highlighting the diverse magical communities and their responses to the growing threats posed by dark wizards such as Gellert Grindelwald[32][33].
The political undercurrents of the film are emphasized by its plot, which revolves around an election and the various power struggles within the wizarding world. This aspect of the story reflects a conscious effort to engage with the political climate of the 1930s, drawing parallels to real-world events and ideologies that were taking shape during that tumultuous decade[34][32]. However, critiques of the film suggest that while it aims to tackle political themes, it ultimately fails to provide a nuanced exploration of these issues. The characters' political beliefs are not adequately framed or expressed, rendering the film's portrayal of leadership and power dynamics somewhat superficial and apolitical despite its apparent focus on political matters[35][36].
Moreover, the film's approach to character development and emotional engagement has been criticized. For instance, Jacob Kowalski, while positioned as a central character, serves more as a point of view for adult viewers rather than being intricately tied to the film's core conflicts. His narrative arc, particularly concerning his relationship with Queenie, is perceived as underdeveloped and treated with a lack of seriousness[37][36]. This has led to the film being described as catering to older fans of the \"Harry Potter\" series while simultaneously feeling juvenile in its execution, resulting in a disconnect between the intended audience and the storytelling approach[36][38].

# Visual and Technical Aspects

## Conceptual Development

The visual style of *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* was significantly shaped by the collaborative efforts of concept artists Jack Dudman, Eva Kuntz, and Dermot Power. Their illustrations provided the foundational vision for the film's aesthetic, working in conjunction with the production design team, which included Neil Lamont and Stuart Craig[3][4]. This initial phase set the stage for the film's unique visual identity.

## Camera Testing

A critical component of the film's visual development involved extensive camera tests, orchestrated by cinematographer Richmond. This process was designed to ensure coherence among the production departments by aligning their visual interpretations. For the character of Dumbledore, Richmond conducted two key tests: one that evaluated camera and LUT against various set sections featuring costumed stand-ins, and another that focused on assessing looks in relation to costume, hair, and make-up[3][4].
These tests involved varying lighting setups, which included side lights, front and back lights, low lights, and a 3/4 back light, as well as the use of smoke to manipulate atmospheric effects. This meticulous approach allowed the team to assess how different lighting configurations affected the film's color and contrast, thus ensuring that the visual storytelling remained impactful and cohesive throughout the production[3][2].

## Color and Lighting Techniques

Cinematography in *The Secrets of Dumbledore* is characterized by a strong emphasis on color and lighting, which are essential for conveying the film's themes and emotions. Cinematographers worked closely with directors to select a color palette that enhances the narrative and engages the audience. By manipulating color through lighting, filters, and camera settings, the filmmakers were able to create distinct visual atmospheres that influenced audience perception. For instance, warm lighting contributed to a sense of intimacy, while cooler tones evoked feelings of detachment[39][9][40].

## Advancements in Color Technology

The film also benefited from advancements in digital cinematography, particularly through the use of High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging. This technology allows for a broader range of luminance, resulting in more vivid colors and deeper contrasts. Such innovations not only enhance the visual appeal of the film but also provide filmmakers with expanded creative possibilities for storytelling. Staying updated on these technological advancements has become essential for film professionals, ensuring that the visual narrative remains compelling and dynamic[41][42][37][43].

# Character Relationships

## Dumbledore and Grindelwald

One of the most significant relationships in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" is that between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. This dynamic has captivated fans due to Dumbledore's complex history, particularly his childhood friendship with Grindelwald and the lasting guilt he harbors over their past. The film explores Dumbledore's efforts to reconcile with his former ally, whose actions have caused considerable pain, including the death of Dumbledore's sister. Jude Law portrays Dumbledore with a sense of calm introspection, while Mads Mikkelsen embodies Grindelwald's confident malevolence, creating a tense and dramatic interplay between the characters[44][45][29].

## Other Character Dynamics

In contrast to the depth of Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship, many other characters in \"The Secrets of Dumbledore\" seem to lack authentic emotional engagement. While familiar characters like Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, and Yusuf Kama return, their motivations often feel superficial, and their interactions do not reflect the emotional weight of past events, such as the death of Leta Lestrange at Grindelwald's hands. Critics have noted that these characters serve more as tools to advance the plot rather than as fully realized individuals with complex emotions and goals[46][47][48][49].
Despite the film's attempt to maintain continuity with previous installments, the character relationships often appear disconnected from their historical contexts, leading to a narrative that feels fragmented and lacking in real emotional stakes[35][50].
