# Background

Pope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger, served as the head of the Catholic Church from 2005 until his historic resignation in 2013, marking the first time in six centuries that a pope voluntarily stepped down from the papacy[1][2]. He passed away at the age of 95 on January 5, 2023, at 9:34 AM in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican, where he had lived after his resignation due to health complications[1][2][17]. His declining health was a concern for many, especially after Pope Francis publicly noted that Benedict was \"very ill\" shortly before his death[2][3].
The protocols following the death of a reigning pope typically involve well-established rituals; however, the death of a pope emeritus, like Benedict XVI, prompted unique considerations. His passing elicited expressions of deep mourning from various leaders around the world, including President Augusto Santos Silva of Portugal, who described the event as a moment of profound sorrow for the Catholic Church and its followers[4][5]. In Romania, Margareta, the Custodian of the Crown, sent condolences to Pope Francis, extending her sympathies to Catholics in Romania and Moldova[18][5]. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin characterized Benedict as \"a prominent religious figure and statesman,\" recognizing his commitment to traditional Christian values[18][5].

# Legacy

Pope Benedict XVI's legacy is multifaceted, reflecting his profound influence on Catholic thought and liturgical practice. His major contribution to theological discourse is his exploration of \"active participation,\" a key principle from the Second Vatican Council aimed at revitalizing the liturgical experience. Ratzinger emphasized that the essence of liturgy is derived from its inherent nature rather than from human actions, stating, “The liturgy derives its greatness from what it is, not from what we do with it…. Liturgy is not an expression of the community’s consciousness, which in any case is diffuse and changing. It is revelation received in faith and prayer”[39][40].
Beyond liturgical renewal, Benedict XVI's vision encompassed a broader understanding of faith and its relationship with reason. He proposed a \"simple and full faith,\" presenting a Church that is primarily a divine creation rather than a human endeavor. This perspective is particularly significant in an age marked by skepticism and disillusionment, as his teachings urged a radical trust in God[10][30]. His legacy also includes the idea of a \"smaller, purer Church,\" which he and subsequent Pope Francis articulated in response to declining church membership in the West, attributed to various crises and scandals within the Church[11][41].
Benedict XVI's approach to theology and Church governance, including the unprecedented creation of the \"Pope Emeritus\" title, reflects his commitment to theological creativity and pastoral integrity. This innovation was seen as a way to address the unique circumstances surrounding his resignation, fostering a deeper theological reflection on the nature of papal authority and governance[36]. Ultimately, his legacy is characterized by a harmonious interplay between faith and reason, a commitment to divine truth, and an enduring invitation to a deeper spiritual engagement with the Church[10][16].
