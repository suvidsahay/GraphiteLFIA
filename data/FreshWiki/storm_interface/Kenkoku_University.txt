# summary

Kenkoku University, also known as Kendai [ˈkɛndaɪ], was an educational institution established in 1938 in Xinjing (modern-day Changchun, Jilin province), the capital of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in occupied Manchuria during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Founded by General Kanji Ishiwara, a key figure in the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the university aimed to cultivate leaders for a new pan-Asian order under Japanese hegemony. Its mission was to promote \"ethnic harmony\" and legitimize the Japanese occupation by recruiting a diverse student body from Japan, China, Mongolia, Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, and Russia. Despite its ideological contradictions, Kenkoku University left a lasting impact on East Asia through its alumni, who played significant roles in the region's postwar development.[1][2]
Under the administration of Professor Shoichi Sakuda from Kyoto University, Kenkoku University offered free tuition, board, lodging, and stipends to its students. This support aimed to create an environment of ethnic equality while simultaneously imposing Japanese customs and beliefs. The curriculum was designed to embed the principles of Pan-Asianism, an ideology advocating for the unity of Asian peoples under Japanese leadership, within the academic experience. However, the reality often reflected Japanese cultural hegemony, creating a paradox between the university's proclaimed ideals and its practices.[1][3]
Throughout its operational period until its closure in 1945, following the defeat of the Kwantung Army by the Soviet Red Army, Kenkoku University played a crucial role in shaping the political and economic landscape of East Asia. The alumni, who formed associations and maintained contact across different countries, including South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan, implemented goals of national liberation and state-led industrialization in their respective nations. This legacy of technocratic state-building inspired by Japanese training persisted in the region's postwar states, illustrating the enduring influence of the university's educational philosophy.[2][4]
Kenkoku University remains a subject of scholarly inquiry, especially regarding its ideological contradictions and the broader implications of Pan-Asianism. Researchers like Yuka Hiruma Kishida have explored the dynamics between the universalism of Pan-Asianist ideals and the particularism of Japanese hegemonic power. Despite its origins as an instrument of imperial propaganda, the university has become a unique historical footnote in the relationship between Japan and China, with its history being revisited and re-examined in recent years.[3][5]

# History

Kenkoku University, also known as Kendai [ˈkɛndaɪ], was an educational institution established in Xinjing (modern Changchun, Jilin province), the capital of Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in occupied Manchuria during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It operated from May 1938 to August 7, 1945[1]. The university was founded by General Kanji Ishiwara, a major architect of the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, with the aim of nurturing the leaders of a new pan-Asian order under Japanese hegemony[2][1].
The university was run by Professor Shoichi Sakuda of Kyoto University. Its purpose was to promote \"ethnic harmony\" in the region, legitimizing and promoting the Japanese occupation[1]. To this end, students were recruited from various regions, including Japan, China proper, Mongolia, Taiwan, Manchuria, Korea, and Russia[1]. Kenkoku offered free tuition, board, lodgings, and a stipend to its students, aiming to create an environment that would foster ethnic equality while simultaneously imposing Japanese customs and beliefs[3][1].
Throughout its existence, Kenkoku University played a significant role in shaping the political and economic landscape of East Asia. Alumni from the institution went on to implement their goals of national liberation and state-led industrialization in the region's postwar states, contributing to the legacy of technocratic state-building inspired by their Japanese training[2]. The influence of Kenkoku University extended beyond its closure in 1945, with its alumni forming associations and maintaining contact across different countries, including South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan[2].
The university closed in 1945 when the Kwantung Army was defeated by the Soviet Red Army[1]. Despite its relatively short operational period, Kenkoku University left a lasting impact on East Asia, with its alumni continuing to influence the region's development and governance in the years following the end of the Japanese Empire[2].

# Philosophy and Objectives

Kenkoku University, also known as Nation-Building University, was founded in 1938 in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo with the overarching aim of realizing the goal of minzoku kyowa, or \"ethnic harmony\"[4][5]. The institution sought to promote an idealistic vision of Pan-Asianism, an ideology advocating for the unity and cooperation of Asian peoples under Japanese leadership. The university was the brainchild of Ishiwara Kanji, the maverick commander responsible for the invasion and occupation of Manchuria in 1931, and aimed to cultivate a new generation of leaders for Manchukuo[4][3].
A core objective of Kenkoku University was to foster ethnic equality among its diverse student body, which included individuals of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, Mongolian, and Russian backgrounds[6][5]. This diverse enrollment was intended to symbolize the ideal of ethnic harmony and to promote a sense of Pan-Asian unity. However, the institution also imposed Japanese customs and beliefs on all students, creating a paradox between the proclaimed ideals of equality and the reality of Japanese cultural hegemony[3][5].
Kenkoku University’s curriculum was designed to embed the principles of Pan-Asianism within the educational experience. It included rigorous academic programs that emphasized the universalism of Pan-Asianist idealism while simultaneously navigating the particularism and power hierarchies inherent in Japanese imperialism[4][3]. The educational mission was to interrogate whether Pan-Asianism could coexist with individual nationalisms, a theme that often sparked heated debates and criticisms among the students regarding Japan's policies and the ongoing war[6].
The university's philosophical and educational mission not only promoted theoretical understandings of Pan-Asianism but also focused on its practical implementation in the daily lives of students and faculty. This approach facilitated dynamic exchanges of ideas about the meaning of Asian unity, revealing both the convergences and clashes of competing articulations of Pan-Asianism within the campus community[4][5]. Despite the ideological contradictions, the notion of Pan-Asianism retained considerable appeal even as the realities of wartime mobilization intensified the tensions between the ideal and the practice[3][6].

# Academic Programs

Kenkoku University, also known as Nation-Building University, was established to support the Japanese occupation of Manchukuo by promoting \"ethnic harmony\" among various ethnic groups including Japanese, Chinese, Mongolian, Taiwanese, Manchurian, Korean, and Russian students[1]. The university offered a range of academic programs designed to serve the needs of the puppet state's administration and its controlled economy. Notably, the institution provided free tuition, board and lodgings, and stipends to its students[1].

## Curriculum

The university's curriculum was tailored to support the economic and administrative goals of Manchukuo. It included practical and applied subjects such as statistics, bookkeeping, and economic research. For example, Hwang Toyŏn, a Korean associate and Kenkoku lecturer, taught statistics and bookkeeping and conducted research on various economic topics including soybean production, the silk industry, agricultural commodification, and business profitability under the Controlled Economy[2]. This focus on economic subjects aimed to provide students with the skills necessary to contribute to the region's development under Japanese control.

## Cultural and Ethnic Studies

In alignment with its mission to promote ethnic harmony, Kenkoku University placed a significant emphasis on cultural and ethnic studies. This was part of a broader ideological effort to legitimize Japanese occupation and foster a sense of unity among the diverse student body[1]. The educational approach at Kenkoku University has been the subject of scholarly analysis, notably by Yuka Hiruma Kishida, who explored the efforts to conceptualize and implement the ideal of Pan-Asianism through the university's programs[4].

## Research and Collaboration

Kenkoku University also emphasized research and collaboration among industry, university, and government entities. The institution provided support for various research activities, including the promotion of research funding and grants[7]. This collaborative approach was intended to bolster the university's role in the economic and social development of Manchukuo.

## Faculty and Mentorship

The faculty at Kenkoku University included esteemed scholars and experts who played a crucial role in guiding and mentoring students. These educators not only imparted academic knowledge but also motivated students to achieve high levels of academic success[8]. The university's specialized curriculum was designed to help students build courage and confidence to meet the challenges and opportunities that awaited them, both as students and in their future careers[8].
Through its diverse academic programs, Kenkoku University sought to cultivate a generation of leaders capable of contributing to the controlled economy and promoting the ideals of ethnic harmony in Manchukuo.

# Student Demographics and Life

Kenkoku University, operating from 1938 to 1945 in Manchuria, was a unique educational institution that sought to foster a generation of leaders under the ideology of Pan-Asianism. The university was notable for its diverse student body, recruiting elite male students from various backgrounds, including Japan, China, Korea, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia[9][1]. This diverse recruitment was part of the university's mission to promote \"ethnic harmony\" in the region, legitimizing and promoting the Japanese occupation[1].
The selection process for admission was competitive, with a rigorous entrance examination that emphasized physical health as a prerequisite. Of the 670 applicants, only 90 were selected, consisting of 60 Koreans and 30 Japanese students, yielding a competition rate of 7.4 to 1[1]. The students at Kenkoku University were provided with free tuition, board and lodgings, and a stipend, ensuring that financial barriers did not hinder the enrollment of talented individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds[1].
The university's educational mission extended beyond the classroom, as students were encouraged to engage in dialogues about Pan-Asianism and nationalism. These discussions often took place in dorm-room meetings, bars near campus, and through student-run periodicals, reflecting the students' sincere efforts to grapple with the coexistence of their national identities and the broader ideal of Pan-Asianism[6]. Despite the pressures from the Japanese military and the increasing focus on war mobilization, the students continued to explore and debate these complex issues, highlighting their commitment to the university's founding principles[6].
Kenkoku University's promise of ethnic equality distinguished it from other colonial schools within the Japanese Empire. However, this promise was juxtaposed with the imposition of Japanese customs and beliefs on all students, creating a unique but challenging environment for the diverse student body[3][5]. The university's curriculum and daily life were designed to reflect the theory and rhetoric of Pan-Asianism, aiming to create a harmonious yet ideologically controlled community of future leaders[3][5].

# Administration and Governance

Kenkoku University was founded in 1938 by General Kanji Ishiwara, with the primary objective of promoting \"ethnic harmony\" within the region, thereby legitimizing and advancing the Japanese occupation of Manchuria[1]. The university was overseen by Professor Shoichi Sakuda of Kyoto University, who played a pivotal role in its administration[1].
The governance structure of Kenkoku University reflected its mission of fostering ethnic integration and collaboration. Students were recruited from a diverse array of regions, including Japan, China proper, Mongolia, Taiwan, Manchuria, Korea, and Russia, ensuring a broad representation of the populations under Japanese influence[1]. This multicultural approach was designed to inculcate a sense of Pan-Asianism, which was a significant ideological component of the Japanese Empire during this period[3].
The university provided various supports to its students, such as free tuition, board and lodging, and a stipend, thereby reducing economic barriers to education and fostering a dedicated student body[1]. This support structure aimed to create an environment conducive to the students' academic and ideological alignment with the university's goals.
Kenkoku University's administration and governance were thus deeply intertwined with the Japanese imperial agenda, seeking to nurture future leaders who would propagate the ideals of national liberation and state-led industrialization across East Asia[2]. This vision was realized post-World War II, as many of its alumni played significant roles in the political and economic restructuring of East Asian nations[2].

# Cultural Assimilation and Policies

Kenkoku University, established in 1938 in Japanese-occupied Manchuria, was founded with the proclaimed goal of achieving \"ethnic harmony\" (minzoku kyōwa) by recruiting students from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, Mongolian, and Russian[6][3]. The institution's mission was to foster a generation of leaders for the state of Manchukuo, embodying the ideals of Pan-Asianism[1].
Despite its promotion of ethnic equality, Kenkoku University simultaneously imposed Japanese customs and beliefs on its student body. This dual approach distinguished Kendai from other colonial schools within the Japanese Empire[5]. The university offered free tuition, board, lodging, and stipends to attract students from various regions, ostensibly promoting a harmonious multicultural environment[1].
However, the implementation of Pan-Asianism at Kenkoku University was fraught with ideological contradictions. While the institution promoted the rhetoric of ethnic equality, it often reinforced notions of Japanese privilege and supremacy within the imperial context[3]. This created a tension between the universalism of Pan-Asianist idealism and the particularism of Japanese hegemonic power[5]. Students from different ethnic backgrounds engaged in sincere efforts to reconcile their sense of nationalism with the broader ideology of Pan-Asianism, often through heated debates and criticisms of Japan's policies[6].
These ideological tensions were evident in the daily lives of students and faculty, as well as in the curriculum that sought to integrate Pan-Asian ideals into the education system. The experience at Kenkoku University thus serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and contradictions inherent in Japan's wartime ideology of Pan-Asianism[3]. Despite the university's official mission of promoting ethnic harmony, the practical implementation often underscored the complexities and conflicts of such an endeavor[5].

# Legacy and Impact

In 1954, former students of Kenkoku University founded the Kenkoku University Alumni Association in Japan, which facilitated contact between South Korean, Japanese, and Chinese alumni, including group visits between countries starting in the 1950s[2]. From 1980 onwards, alumni made four visits to mainland China, assisted by high-ranking CCP officials who were former Kenkoku students and had endured hardships during the Cultural Revolution[2]. These alumni played significant roles in East Asia's postwar order, with their careers often extending into the 1990s. They implemented goals of national liberation and state-led industrialization across the region, affecting both sides of the Cold War divide[2].
Kenkoku University was the highest academic institution in Manchukuo from 1938 until 1945 and served as the educational center of the pan-Asianist experiment. Students from across Asia under Japanese rule attended the university to learn how to modernize Asia[2]. Despite the end of the Japanese empire, the technocratic state-building tradition that Manchukuo’s rulers inculcated in their students endured. Many of East Asia's new leaders utilized their Japanese training to construct the successor regimes, embedding the legacy of Kenkoku in their political achievements[2].
In recent years, the dwindling number of surviving students, their families, and researchers of Kenkoku University's history have come to share a sense of cross-national unity, built on friendships forged at the Japan-run university[9]. Despite its origin as a piece of imperial propaganda, Kenkoku University has become a unique footnote in the relationship between Japan and China, with its history being revisited and re-examined[9].
The ideological contradictions and the legacy of Kenkoku University have been the subject of scholarly inquiry. Researchers have explored the dissemination and reception of pan-Asian thought at a grassroots level, contributing to the growing literature on the history of regionalism in East Asia[3]. The university's establishment by General Kanji Ishiwara and its operation under Professor Shoichi Sakuda aimed to promote \"ethnic harmony\" and legitimize Japanese occupation by recruiting students from a diverse array of regions including Japan, China, Mongolia, Taiwan, Manchuria, Korea, and Russia, providing them with free tuition, board, lodging, and a stipend[1].
Yuka Hiruma Kishida's comprehensive book further illuminates these dynamics, offering new insights into the tensions between the universalism of Pan-Asianist ideals and the particularism and power hegemony rooted in notions of Japanese privilege and supremacy within the imperial context[3][5].
