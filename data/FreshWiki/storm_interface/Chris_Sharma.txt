# Mental Training and Preparation

Chris Sharma emphasizes the significance of mental preparation as a cornerstone of climbing performance. His approach focuses on three key areas: visualization, intrinsic motivation, and the practice of trying hard on less significant climbs.

## Visualization

Prior to attempting a challenging route, Sharma engages in extensive visualization exercises. He imagines himself successfully completing the climb, detailing every movement, handhold, and foot placement required for each sequence. This mental rehearsal not only helps him to imprint the route in his memory but also builds confidence in his abilities as he prepares for the physical challenge ahead[41][42].

## Intrinsic Motivation

Sharma advocates for cultivating intrinsic motivation, which he defines as the drive to climb for the sheer love of the sport rather than for external rewards, such as recognition or social validation. He believes that climbers who are intrinsically motivated will find it easier to exert maximum effort during their climbs because their enjoyment of the process is detached from the outcomes[5][43]. This intrinsic approach fosters a deeper commitment to the sport and enhances overall performance.

## Practicing Hard Efforts

Sharma advises climbers to practice trying hard on routes that may not matter to them or on climbs they are unlikely to complete. He points out that significant climbs and achievements occur infrequently, so it is essential to build the habit of exerting effort consistently, regardless of the perceived importance of the route. This method allows climbers to develop resilience and the capacity to perform under pressure when it truly counts[30][44]. By treating every climb as an opportunity to push one’s limits, Sharma argues that climbers can maximize their potential and better prepare for challenging ascents[8][45].

# Climbing Gear

Chris Sharma is renowned not only for his impressive climbing achievements but also for his contributions to climbing gear design. He has been instrumental in the development of high-performance climbing shoes tailored for both steep cave climbing and bouldering. One notable model is designed with a downturned profile and high asymmetry, enabling enhanced precision and power on challenging routes[13][46].

## Footwear Innovations

Sharma's collaboration with various brands has led to significant advancements in climbing shoe technology. For instance, the shoes he designed feature a unique mold process that creates individual fits for each pair, offering a level of comfort and durability that sets them apart from other high-end models[14][47]. Black Diamond® climbing shoes, favored by many climbers, embody this innovation, providing versatility and performance across different climbing scenarios[14][48].

## Technical Clothing

In addition to footwear, Sharma has also influenced the design of climbing apparel. He is known for promoting technical clothing that enhances both performance and comfort while climbing. This includes features that support freedom of movement and durability, crucial for both recreational and professional climbers[15][49].

## Mental Preparation

Sharma emphasizes that climbing is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one. He has advocated for mental training techniques that help climbers prepare for the psychological demands of the sport, which can be crucial for optimal performance under pressure[31][50]. This holistic approach to climbing gear and preparation reflects Sharma's understanding of the sport's complexities and his dedication to advancing climbing as both an art and a science.
