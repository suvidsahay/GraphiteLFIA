The Queue symbolized not only a national tribute to the late monarch but also served as a reflection of British identity and the deep-seated respect for royal tradition that has shaped the nation for generations.[1][2][3].
Forming on the morning of September 14, the Queue stretched over 10 miles at its peak, with mourners waiting for up to 24 hours to pay their respects in Westminster Hall.[4][5] Despite its organized nature, which included a dedicated route, first aid points, and a colored wristband system to manage participants, the Queue faced logistical challenges, including initial issues with tracking technology that misdirected attendees.[6][7] These elements contributed to a complex public response, blending feelings of grief with a sense of duty and community among those waiting in line.[8][9].

Furthermore, narratives surrounding the Queue revealed a diverse array of motivations among participants, prompting discussions about national identity and the varying perceptions of mourning in contemporary British society.[13][14].
Ultimately, the Queue for Elizabeth II's lying in state transcended mere logistics, evolving into a profound social phenomenon that underscored the power of communal grieving. It served as a vital space for collective remembrance, allowing the nation to process its loss while reinforcing the significance of Elizabeth II's legacy in British history.[15][16][17].

# Background

The Queue for the lying in state of Elizabeth II was a significant national event that followed her death in September 2022. The Queen's passing marked the end of a long and storied reign, which was largely shaped by pivotal moments in British history, including the abdication crisis of 1936. This crisis thrust Edward VIII’s younger brother, Albert, onto the throne as King George VI, subsequently elevating the status of his daughter, Elizabeth, who would later become queen.[1][2].
Elizabeth's formative years were heavily influenced by her father's role during World War II. As a car mechanic with the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), she gained firsthand experience in what was described as \"the people’s war,\" which instilled in her a sense of connection with the common citizenry, distinguishing her from previous monarchs.[3] Her marriage to Philip Mountbatten in 1947 also served as a moment of national optimism, providing a bright spot during a time of post-war austerity and rationing.[4].
The public's reaction to Elizabeth II’s passing and the Queue itself was emblematic of the profound respect and admiration she commanded, drawing thousands to pay their respects in a ceremonial setting that highlighted her legacy. The Queue became a focal point for mourning, drawing not just those who admired the Queen but also a reflection of national identity intertwined with royal tradition.[5][6].

# Details of the Queue

The queue for the lying in state of Queen Elizabeth II began forming in the early morning of 14 September 2022, and continued to grow throughout the day. By 09:50 on 16 September, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport declared that the queue had reached full capacity for the first time, resulting in a temporary pause on entry for six hours[7][8]. When both the main and accessible queues reached their maximum capacity, arriving mourners were directed to a designated \"holding pen\" in Southwark Park, which was humorously dubbed a \"queue for the queue\" by the press[7][9].

## Queue Length and Waiting Times

The queue's length fluctuated, at its maximum stretching up to 10 miles (16 kilometers), with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark[10][11]. At peak times, mourners were informed they could expect a wait of over 24 hours[12][13]. However, estimates varied throughout the duration of the queue, with reports indicating lengths of 4.9 miles and waiting times of approximately 11 hours at certain points[14].

## Organisation and Logistics

The queue was meticulously organised, with a designated route lined with first aid points and staffed by nearly 800 paid stewards, supported by 100 civil service volunteers and hundreds of Scouts[15][16]. Participants were advised against bringing camping equipment or large bags, and a coloured wristband system was implemented to allow queuers to temporarily leave the line without losing their place[16]. The Greater London Authority, in collaboration with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, provided live updates on social media regarding the status of the queue, while also offering real-time information about the queue's tail-end using what3words codes[9][17].

## Accessibility

For those needing assistance, an accessible queue was established with step-free access to Westminster Hall, where guide dogs and assistance dogs were permitted. British Sign Language interpreters were available, and visitor assistants were present to guide wheelchair users and individuals with mobility challenges along the route[10][14]. The accessible queue had to be paused due to high demand but was reopened for several hours to accommodate previously allocated time slots[10].

## Challenges

Despite the efforts to manage the queue effectively, there were initial issues with the what3words system used to convey the queue's tail-end location. Of the first five codes issued, four led to incorrect locations, including a suburb of London 15 miles away from the actual queue end[9][2]. This prompted officials to switch to an automated system for generating these identifiers to prevent future errors[2][17].

# Public Response

The queue for the lying in state of Elizabeth II elicited a complex response from the public, reflecting a mixture of grief, duty, and a sense of community. Despite the historical significance of the event, many attendees expressed their participation in terms of a “fear of missing out,” emphasizing the desire to be part of a collective experience rather than solely mourning the loss of the queen[18][19]. This sentiment transformed the queue itself into an event, with individuals gathering not only to pay respects but also to engage in a shared atmosphere akin to that of major sporting events[13][20].
However, the experience was not without its challenges. Reports indicated that hundreds of people collapsed or fainted while waiting in line, with dozens requiring hospitalization[21][22]. Critics highlighted that the logistical aspects of managing the queue appeared to prioritize aesthetics—such as discouraging the placement of supermarket flowers—over the wellbeing of mourners[22][23]. Concerns arose about the infrastructure in place to support the crowd, leading some to worry about the potential for serious or permanent health consequences due to the lack of adequate care[24][25].
Additionally, the portrayal of the crowd revealed a need for a nuanced understanding of public sentiment. Early days of the queue were dominated by logistical barriers like work commitments and geographical distance, which affected who could participate[26][27]. This highlighted a diversity of motivations among attendees, ranging from those who felt obligated to honor the monarchy to others who questioned the costs associated with the ceremonial aspects of the event. Critics argued against simplistic narratives that labeled those not participating in the queue as “un-British,” emphasizing that such portrayals ignored the multifaceted nature of national identity and grief in contemporary society[26][28].

# Media Coverage

The queue for the lying in state of Elizabeth II garnered significant media attention, reflecting the event's historical importance and the public's engagement. Various news outlets reported on the orderly and serene atmosphere among the mourners, highlighting the efforts made by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to manage the queue effectively. The DCMS implemented measures such as a tracker to indicate the queue’s endpoint and provided stewards to distribute wristbands, allowing participants to temporarily leave without losing their place in line[29][30].
In addition to the management of the queue, the DCMS utilized social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to provide live updates on queue status and logistics, which kept the public informed throughout the event[30][16]. The operation was supported by nearly 800 paid stewards and numerous volunteers, demonstrating a well-coordinated effort by the Greater London Authority and DCMS[31][32].
Media coverage also addressed the diverse motivations and experiences of the crowd. Commentators emphasized the need to avoid oversimplified narratives that could misrepresent the sentiments of those who chose to queue or those who held different views about the monarchy. Analysts noted that factors such as work commitments and geographical distance influenced attendance, which contributed to varied public expressions of grief and celebration across different regions, including Brighton and Edinburgh[32][33]. This nuanced understanding aimed to reflect a broader representation of British identity during a significant national event.

# Comparisons to Previous Events

## Nature of Crowds

The Queue for the lying in state of Elizabeth II exhibited significant temporal differences compared to previous events, particularly in the way crowds interacted and identified with each other. In contrast to earlier gatherings, such as those for past monarchs, participants in the Queue shared a more tangible experience, often marked by physical proximity and the use of indicators like wristbands that signified their shared purpose and experience[32][34][35]. This created a collective identity that was notably absent for individuals who joined the crowds later, such as on the morning of September 19. The lack of immediate shared identification for these later arrivals diminished the potential for the psychological transformation typically associated with large gatherings, resulting in a less cohesive experience[28][19].

## Historical Context

The tradition of lying in state dates back to the Stuart period (1603-1714), when sovereigns would lie in state for several days. However, it was Edward VII who formalized the modern practice in 1910, setting the stage for how such events are conducted today. This historical backdrop emphasizes the evolution of crowd dynamics at these significant occasions. For example, during Edward VII's lying in state, large lines of mourners formed in central London, similar to those seen during Elizabeth II's Queue, highlighting a long-standing tradition of public mourning and engagement with the monarchy[36][37][38].

## Queue Management and Scale

The Queue for Elizabeth II’s lying in state was unprecedented in scale, with officials anticipating record numbers of attendees, potentially stretching the Queue to eight kilometers (five miles) long[2]. As early as September 14, the main queue began to form, illustrating the public's eagerness to participate in this historical moment. The situation reached a peak on September 16, when the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced that the queue had reached full capacity for the first time, resulting in temporary pauses for entry[25][31][39]. This level of organization and crowd management marks a significant logistical evolution from past events, reflecting the lessons learned from historical queues and the need for a well-coordinated approach to handle massive crowds effectively.

# Societal Insights

The Queue for the lying in state of Elizabeth II served not only as a means for individuals to pay their respects but also as a profound social phenomenon, revealing deep insights into collective grief and identity. Participants of varying ages, including families with children and military veterans, gathered to honor the late monarch, highlighting the broad demographic representation present during this significant event[40][41]. This assembly of mourners can be understood through the lens of crowd psychology, where individuals come together to form a psychological crowd that shares a common identity and sense of purpose, particularly during times of collective mourning[32][13][35].

## Collective Identity and Grief Processing

Research suggests that joining crowds in such contexts can facilitate the processing of grief, as individuals find solace in the shared experience of loss[28][42]. The phenomenon of “common fate” emerges in these gatherings, where participants perceive their shared sorrow as a unifying factor that promotes emotional support and solidarity among strangers[32][43]. For many, the act of waiting in The Queue was described as a positive experience, characterized by the sense of community and connection fostered during the hours spent together[13][26].

## Emotional Experiences in The Queue

The emotional landscape of those in The Queue was multifaceted, with many individuals reporting intense feelings of sadness and nostalgia, which were often associated with heightened levels of identity fusion and commitment to the collective[42][35]. As mourners approached the coffin, the atmosphere was laden with respect and solemnity, reflecting the significance of the occasion. Participants engaged in various forms of tribute, from bows and curtseys to salutes, reinforcing the ceremonial nature of their gathering and the shared respect for the Queen’s lifetime of service[40][44].

## Liminality and Transformation

The days following Queen Elizabeth II's passing have been described as a liminal occasion, wherein participants navigate through the transition from grief to remembrance[39]. This transitional space allows individuals not only to mourn but also to collectively commemorate the monarch's legacy, illustrating the power of public mourning in facilitating both personal and societal healing[28][20]. The Queue, therefore, transcended mere physicality; it became a significant ritual space where collective memories and identities were formed and reformed, demonstrating the role of communal experiences in shaping societal narratives during times of national mourning[32][45].
