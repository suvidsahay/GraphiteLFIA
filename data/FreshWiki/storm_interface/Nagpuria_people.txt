# History

## Colonial Influence

During the period of British rule, the colonial administration made significant inroads into the adivasi tribal system, leading to widespread resentment among the tribespeople. Many tribesmen actively supported rebellions against the British, while local rulers (rajas) viewed British administrative changes unfavorably. The 18th century marked the beginning of a consolidation of feudalism in India, initiated by the British through systems like Jagirdari and zamindari. The Permanent Settlement in Bengal and Bihar served as a precursor to a broader feudal restructuring across India, which drastically altered the existing social and economic frameworks of the country[1][2].

## Land Rights and Migration

In the early 20th century, improved transportation and communication networks resulted in the appropriation of vast tracts of land by non-tribal settlers. The British government implemented settlement schemes that granted land ownership to inward migrants who agreed to cultivate it, a concept that conflicted with the tribal perspective of land as a communal resource. By the time many tribal communities recognized the need for formal land titles, they had already lost their claims to the lands they historically occupied. Although colonial and post-independence administrations later acknowledged the necessity to protect tribal lands from encroachment, loopholes such as land leases continued to undermine these efforts. Despite these challenges, some gains were made for tribal communities in the mid-20th century, including the return of certain lands, albeit against significant local resistance from authorities[3][4].

## Socio-Political Dynamics

The term \"Adivasi,\" used to denote indigenous tribes, encompasses a complex history of migration and displacement. Scholars argue that the perception of Adivasis as the original inhabitants is complicated by the historical migrations of various groups into these areas, often at the expense of existing populations. This nuanced understanding of indigeneity highlights the socio-political dynamics in which tribes have operated and the various external pressures they have faced over the centuries[5][6].

# Language

The Nagpuriya people primarily speak Nagpuri, an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the family of languages found in eastern central India. This language is prevalent among the tribes in the state of Jharkhand, and it has several dialectal varieties including Sadri, Khortha, and Kurmali. The complex linguistic landscape of this region highlights the significance of these tribal languages, which are at risk of extinction without immediate preservation efforts[7][8].
In terms of linguistic characteristics, Nagpuri exhibits unique phonological features that distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages. This includes specific patterns of consonant and vowel phonemes, as well as distinct morphological markers that contribute to its syntax and grammar[9][10]. The interactions among the various languages in this region often lead to a borrowing of phonological features, creating a rich tapestry of linguistic influence and diversity[8].
Furthermore, Nagpuri does not possess a dedicated script and is commonly written using the Devanagari script, which is also employed for several other regional languages. This choice of script reflects the broader cultural and linguistic exchanges present in the area, as many speakers are bilingual or multilingual, often switching between Nagpuri and other regional languages like Hindi or Bengali[7][11][12].

# Culture

The culture of the Nagpuriya people is rich and diverse, characterized by a blend of traditional practices, art forms, and festivals that reflect their historical heritage and social identity.

## Traditional Arts and Crafts

Nagpuriya culture is marked by various artistic expressions, including dance, music, and crafts. The folk dance of the region, such as Dhumal and Chhau, is performed during significant events like weddings and festivals, serving both entertainment and social bonding purposes[13][14]. Additionally, crafts such as wood carving, bamboo crafts, and traditional mask making are prevalent, with artisans producing masks that differ in style and expression from those of neighboring states[15][16].

## Music and Folklore

Music plays a vital role in the cultural life of the Nagpuriya people. It encompasses a variety of forms, including traditional songs known as Rabindra Sangeet, which are an integral part of their musical landscape[17]. The music often accompanies dance performances, where instruments like dhol, mandar, and sarangi are commonly used[18][19]. Folklore is an essential aspect of their culture, passed down through generations and capturing the community's traditional beliefs and customs[20].

## Festivals

Festivals are a crucial part of Nagpuriya culture, celebrated with enthusiasm and community participation. Major festivals include Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja, with celebrations lasting several days across various localities[21]. The Sohrai harvest festival, primarily celebrated by the Santal tribe, is also significant, marking the time for gratitude and community gatherings after the harvest season[22].

## Traditional Attire

Traditional clothing plays an important role in the identity of the Nagpuriya people. Women often wear a lugra, a traditional garment, while men typically don khaki shorts and white banian[16][17]. The attire varies during festive occasions, where unique styles and fabrics reflect the community's rich cultural heritage.

# Social structure

The social structure of the Nagpuriya people is complex and multifaceted, exhibiting characteristics that align with both tribal and caste systems. Scholars have noted that distinguishing between a \"tribe\" and a \"caste\" can be problematic, as many social groups, including the Nagpuriya, do not fit neatly into these categories. The classification often depends on internal social organization, relationships with other groups, self-classification, and external perceptions, which can lead to ambiguities in categorization[23][24].

## Caste and Tribe Distinctions

Traditionally, the terms \"caste\" and \"tribe\" have been used interchangeably, causing confusion even among early legal codifiers in India. The distinction between these social groups does not always provide meaningful insights into social dynamics, as each group may have unique characteristics that do not align with conventional definitions[6][25]. For the Nagpuriya, this means that aspects of both tribal customs and caste-based social norms may coexist and interact within their communities.

## Marriage Practices

One significant feature of Nagpuriya social structure is the practice of clan exogamy. Like many tribal communities, they tend to marry outside their totemic divisions, which helps to foster alliances and social cohesion. Research has indicated that this practice is strictly observed, with documentation showing no breaches of village exogamy among recorded marriages[26][27]. This adherence to clan exogamy is essential for maintaining social boundaries and fostering community solidarity.

## Social Boundaries and Interaction

The social boundaries within Nagpuriya society are defined through a combination of cultural practices, social interactions, and classification systems unique to their community. Social classification can vary significantly from one regional society to another, and understanding these classifications requires examining both internal structures and external influences[23][28]. The interplay between social boundaries and modes of interaction within the Nagpuriya community underscores the complexity of their social organization and reflects broader trends observed in Indian society.

# Religion and beliefs

The Nagpuriya people, like many tribal communities in India, exhibit a diverse range of religious beliefs and practices that vary among different tribes. A significant majority, over 89%, identify as Hindus and adhere to various aspects of Hinduism, although their practices often diverge from mainstream Hindu customs[29][6]. The Adivasi beliefs are typically distinct from the historical Vedic religion, characterized by nature worship, lack of idol worship, and the absence of reincarnation concepts[29][6][30].
Christianity has made inroads among the Nagpuriya, with approximately 5.53% of the population embracing the faith, primarily due to the efforts of Christian missionaries. This conversion has not been without its challenges, as many individuals face social and cultural conflicts between their tribal heritage and the newly adopted Christian traditions[29][24]. In addition, some tribes, particularly in areas like Lakshadweep, identify as Muslim, having adopted Islam during the 14th century, while about 4.19% of the population adheres to distinct indigenous religions[6][30].
There have been reports of tensions surrounding religious conversions, particularly accusations against Christians of \"forced conversions\" among tribal populations, leading to the imprisonment of some individuals[31][32]. Recently, there has also been a growing trend of proselytization from Hindutva groups targeting tribal communities, further complicating the religious landscape. For instance, in the Dang district, tribals are being encouraged to convert to Hinduism by organizations such as the BJP and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP)[31][32].
Tribal ancestor worshippers in regions like the Nilgiris have expressed objections to being classified strictly as Hindu, Muslim, or Christian, highlighting the complexities of identity within these communities[31][32]. Overall, the religious beliefs and practices among the Nagpuriya are marked by a rich tapestry of traditions that reflect both historical and contemporary influences.

# Contemporary issues

The Nagpuriya people face several contemporary issues that impact their socio-economic conditions and cultural identity. One of the primary challenges is high drop-out rates in education, where children often attend school for only a few years before becoming illiterate. Although some students may continue their education up to the tenth grade, very few complete high school, severely limiting their eligibility for higher education opportunities[33][34].
Additionally, members of agrarian tribes, such as the Gonds, show reluctance to send their children to school due to socio-economic factors. This educational disparity contributes to the ongoing cycle of poverty and unemployment within the community[30][28].
Economically, many Nagpuriya individuals experience livelihood insecurity, primarily due to a lack of employment opportunities in their villages. The rural economy is marked by underdevelopment, with many tribal regions being highly vulnerable and lacking in basic infrastructure[35][36]. The historical context of land ownership has also complicated their economic situation; practices such as subinfeudation have altered traditional land use and ownership patterns, leading to greater economic hardship[37][38].
Moreover, the legacy of the tribal revolts, particularly the Munda Rebellion, has influenced the political landscape for the Nagpuriya people, fostering a sense of political awakening. This awakening is exemplified by their war cry, \"Abua Dishom, Abua Raj,\" which underscores a desire for autonomy and recognition[34][39]. Despite these efforts, the community continues to grapple with social challenges such as poverty, inequality, and caste discrimination, which further exacerbate their economic difficulties[2][40][41].

# Notable figures

The Nagpuriya people have produced several notable figures who have significantly contributed to various fields such as politics, literature, and social activism.

## Historical Leaders

One of the prominent figures is **Vishwanath Shahdeo**, who played an active role in the 1857 rebellion against British rule and is recognized as a freedom fighter[42]. Another key leader is **Udai Pratap Nath Shah Deo**, a Nagvanshi king, whose legacy includes his influence in the socio-political landscape of the region[43].

## Political Activists

**Lal Chintamani Sharan Nath Shahdeo** was the last Nagvanshi king and a notable politician, known for his efforts in the political sphere of Maharashtra[43]. Additionally, **Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo** made his mark as a jurist and political activist, advocating for legal reforms and justice within the community[44].

## Writers and Intellectuals

The Nagpuriya community has also seen influential writers like **Lal Ranvijay Nath Shahdeo**, who contributed to literature and poetry, enriching the cultural fabric of the region[43]. Furthermore, **Sahani Upendra Pal Singh** emerged as a writer and social commentator, focusing on contemporary issues faced by the Nagpuriya people[43].
These figures collectively represent the diverse contributions of the Nagpuriya people to India's history and cultural heritage. Their legacies continue to inspire future generations within the community.
