# History

## Founding and Early Years

Edwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by physicist Frederick David (F. D.) Edwards and his father, William Edwards, in Camberwell, London, initially as Edwards Equipment and Services. The company specialized in importing and selling vacuum pumps to research laboratories across the UK, France, Germany, and the USA[1][2]. With the onset of World War II, the company faced challenges as it was cut off from its German suppliers due to the voiding of patents, prompting it to start manufacturing its own products in 1939[4].

## Corporate Evolution

After the war, the firm underwent a series of rebranding and relocations, becoming W Edwards and Co in 1940, then Edwards High Vacuum International Ltd in 1950, and moving its headquarters from London to Crawley in 1953[4]. In the mid-1950s, Edwards expanded its capabilities by acquiring Italian freeze-drying equipment manufacturer Alto Vuoto SpA in 1954 and the Shoreham factory from J. H. Holmes and Son Ltd in 1958[4]. The company listed as a public entity in the 1960s but faced financial difficulties and labor strikes. Following the death of F. D. Edwards, the company was sold to BOC Group in 1968, marking the beginning of a new phase of international expansion[3][4].

## BOC and Subsequent Ownership Changes

Under BOC, Edwards experienced significant growth and investment, particularly in its Crawley, Eastbourne, Shoreham, and Burgess Hill sites, expanding its product offerings, especially in the semiconductor manufacturing sector[3][1]. In 1997, BOC merged its electronics gases business with Edwards, branding it as BOC Edwards. In 2006, the company was acquired by Linde and CCMP Capital, before being sold to Atlas Copco in January 2014, which marked another transformative chapter in its history[3][2].

## Recent Developments

In recent years, Edwards Vacuum has focused on the growing demands from the chemical, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing industries, as well as expansion into the oil and gas sector[3][4]. The company's ongoing commitment to innovation was exemplified in 1984 when it patented the first practical high vacuum dry (no-oil) pump, which found substantial application in the rapidly evolving semiconductor manufacturing market[3][5]. In 2023, Edwards has been involved in significant investment projects, including a $212 million semiconductor dry pump manufacturing facility in New York's Green Manufacturing mega site at STAMP, demonstrating its role as a key player in the vacuum equipment industry[3][4].
