# Overview

The 2022 World Figure Skating Championships featured a series of competitive events showcasing elite athletes from around the globe. The competition was divided into singles, pairs, and ice dance categories, each consisting of two portions: the short program and the free skate[1]. The short program, a critical element of the competition, allowed athletes to perform routines filled with technical elements and creative choreography[14].
Historically, figure skating has evolved significantly since its inception. The first recorded account of figure skating, \"A Treatise on Skating,\" was published in 1772 by Englishman Robert Jones. Initially, the sport adhered to a cramped and formal style until American Jackson Haines introduced a more free and expressive technique based on dance movements in the mid-1860s. Despite its popularity in Europe, Haines's style, known as the International style, did not gain traction in the United States until years after his untimely death at the age of 35[14][15].
In the early 20th century, American skaters like Irving Brokaw and George H. Browne played pivotal roles in popularizing and formalizing Haines's style in America. Brokaw became the first American to compete in international competitions, finishing sixth at the 1908 Olympics, while Browne organized the inaugural U.S. championships in 1914 and contributed significantly to the establishment of a national skating organization[14][2].
The event also saw notable performances from athletes who had faced significant challenges in their careers. For instance, Vincent Zhou, a bronze medalist, spoke about overcoming obstacles following a positive COVID-19 test during the Beijing Olympics, which left him feeling immense mental distress despite not suffering physically[10][11]. This backdrop of personal resilience added depth to the competition, showcasing not only athletic prowess but also the emotional journeys of the athletes involved.

# History

The 2022 World Figure Skating Championships marked a significant milestone in the history of U.S. figure skating, particularly in the pairs category. Held in Montpellier, France, Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier achieved a historic victory by winning the gold medal, which was the United States' first World pairs title since 1979[2][3][4][16][17]. The duo scored a competition and career-best total of 221.09 points, including a remarkable free skate score of 144.21 points, showcasing their exceptional performance[2][3][4].
This championship was a continuation of their strong showing in the competitive figure skating landscape, as they had recently earned a silver medal in the team event at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The 2022 World Championships represented only their second appearance at this prestigious event, yet their performance solidified their place in U.S. figure skating history[2][16].
Knierim expressed her overwhelming emotions after the performance, describing it as a mix of gratitude, fulfillment, excitement, and disbelief, calling it a \"magical\" experience[2][17]. Frazier echoed her sentiments, emphasizing their hard work and readiness for the competition, while also showing concern for fellow competitors Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc, highlighting the camaraderie in the sport[2][4][17]. This victory not only underscored their dedication but also revitalized the United States' presence in the pairs discipline on the world stage.

The media coverage of the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships has been extensive, with various platforms providing live and on-demand options for viewers. The BBC has announced that it will broadcast live coverage of all free skate events, along with offering on-demand viewing for up to 30 days following the competitions[25][26]. In the United States, the events are also widely accessible through streaming services, with specific television broadcasts scheduled for various competitions.

In addition to major broadcasting networks, the event organizers are keen to enhance viewer engagement.

The championships serve as a critical platform in the build-up to the following year's Olympics, drawing significant media attention and a broad international audience eager to witness the top competitors in action at venues like Boston's TD Garden[15][32].

# Coaching and Training Evolution

## Influence of International Coaches

The landscape of figure skating coaching in the United States has been significantly shaped by the introduction of international coaches. One notable figure is Carlo Fassi, an Italian singles champion from the 1940s and '50s, who made substantial contributions to American figure skating by coaching prominent athletes such as Linda Fleming and Sarah Hughes, as well as British Olympic champions like John Curry and Robin Cousins[17][33][24][29]. Fassi's approach to coaching emphasized the development of artistic expression alongside technical proficiency, which has since become a hallmark of American training methods.

## Current Training Dynamics

The training dynamics of figure skating have evolved to incorporate a broader range of technical and artistic elements. As seen in recent competitions, the short program serves as a critical component where athletes showcase routines filled with intricate technical elements and creative choreography[32][14]. For instance, Kaori Sakamoto of Japan, who led the women's singles program, demonstrated the importance of balancing artistry with technical precision, aiming for her country's first women's gold at the World Championships since 2014[34].

## Challenges Faced by Athletes

The global context has also impacted training and participation. For example, due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, skaters Sofiia Holichenko and Artem Darenskyi withdrew from competition, citing inadequate training time as a result of the Russian invasion[30][35]. This highlights the challenges athletes face beyond the ice, affecting their performance and opportunities.

## National Achievements and Milestones

Recent achievements underscore the evolution of coaching and training in the United States. Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier's victory marked a historic moment as they secured the first pairs medal for the country since 2002, alongside the first World title since 1979[35]. Furthermore, Japan's Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara achieved the highest-ever placement for a Japanese pair, illustrating the global competitiveness of training systems and the success of international coaching influences on local athletes[35].

# Impact

## Athlete Experience Enhancements

The 2022 World Figure Skating Championships marked a significant shift in how the competition is structured and the experience provided to athletes. A central aspect of this change is the implementation of Vision 2030, which aims to enhance the overall environment for competitors. This includes back-of-the-house upgrades such as exclusive lounges for athletes and calming rooms equipped with therapy dogs to help reduce stress levels[12][13]. The presence of therapy dogs, like Penny, has garnered significant attention, underscoring the emotional support these animals can provide in high-pressure situations[12][19].

## Competitive Structure Innovations

In addition to improvements in athlete comfort, the championships introduced novel features that affected the competitive landscape. One such innovation is the introduction of the \"hot seat,\" a designated area for leading competitors situated adjacent to the kiss-and-cry area, mirroring the time trial concept in Olympic cycling where leaders await their fate under pressure[12][19]. This arrangement not only heightens the tension and excitement of the competition but also places a spotlight on the leading athletes, further enhancing the viewer experience.

## Performance and Recognition

The championships also showcased remarkable performances, particularly in the pairs competition, where established teams and emerging duos competed for recognition. Notably, Deanna Stellato-Dudek made history as the oldest women's world champion in 2024, achieving this milestone with partner Maxime Deschamps[36][6]. Their journey, which included overcoming injuries and illness, captured the spirit of perseverance that the event seeks to embody, further emphasizing the importance of both athletic prowess and personal resilience in the figure skating community[20][37].
