This season was historic, marking the first live competition show to air on Disney+ and the last for host Tyra Banks and judge Len Goodman[9].

# Scores and Eliminations

## Scoring System

The scoring in \"Dancing with the Stars\" operates primarily on a numerical system where each judge assigns a score ranging from 1 to 10. This results in a total score that can vary from 3 to 30 or 40, depending on the number of judges present[19][20]. The scoring system was notably adjusted during the all-star season 15, allowing judges to give scores in half-point increments, yielding a potential score range of 1.5 to 30[16][20]. The judges' scores are then combined with viewer votes to determine which couples are at risk of elimination. The contestants' judges' shares are calculated based on the total points awarded to all contestants that evening, with each couple's score reflecting their performance relative to the others[19].

## Elimination Format

Beginning with season 28, the competition introduced a new elimination format where the two couples with the lowest combined totals of judges' scores and viewer voting percentages were placed in jeopardy of elimination. In these instances, judges had the power to save one of the bottom two couples, ensuring that more talented competitors remained in the competition[21][22]. In cases of double eliminations where three teams faced the risk of going home, the couple with the lowest combined score was eliminated, and the remaining two couples would face a judges' vote to determine who would continue[23]. However, for season 32, this format was reverted to the original rules utilized in the first 27 seasons, eliminating the judges' save option[21][24].

## Final Week Structure

Throughout the history of the show, the structure of the final week has seen various changes. In seasons 1 and 3, only two couples competed in the final week, but starting with season 16, four couples advanced to this stage. Notably, the top three finalists would perform again for the judges after the fourth-place couple was announced[25]. While seasons 20, 22, 24, and 26 featured three couples in the finals, seasons 21, 23, 25, and 27–31 typically had four couples. Season 32 marked a change, allowing five couples to compete in the final week[11].

# Themes and Performances

Season 31 of *Dancing with the Stars* introduced a variety of captivating themes, each designed to showcase the emotional connections and personal stories of the contestants. One of the standout nights was the \"Most Memorable Year\" episode, where each couple performed routines that represented significant moments in their lives, resonating deeply with both the audience and judges[26][27]. This emotional aspect of the show added a layer of storytelling that is often highlighted as a key feature of the competition[28].

## Themed Nights

The season featured several themed nights, including the much-anticipated Disney Night, where performances were centered around popular Disney songs and characters[29][30]. Another exciting theme was \"Dedicated Dance Night,\" where contestants performed dances inspired by their biggest fears and darkest nightmares[31]. These themes not only entertained viewers but also provided a platform for the stars to express their individuality and emotional journeys through dance.
In addition to these, there were plans for an \"Iconic Dances Night,\" where couples would reinterpret famous dances from earlier seasons, celebrating the show's legacy and the memorable performances that have defined it[32]. The inclusion of various music genres such as Broadway, Halloween, and movie themes allowed for a diverse array of performances throughout the season[33][34].

## Performances

The performances themselves varied greatly in style and execution, showcasing a wide range of dance forms, including the Waltz, Cha-Cha-Cha, and Jive, which were popular choices among contestants[13][35]. The choreography and emotional delivery of these performances were critical to their success, as highlighted in the judges' scores and critiques throughout the season[27].
For example, Charli D'Amelio and her partner Mark Ballas delivered a memorable freestyle that stood out among the numerous routines performed[13]. As the season progressed, the performances continued to captivate the audience, blending technical skill with personal narratives, thus enhancing the overall viewing experience[36][21].
The show's emphasis on thematic storytelling, combined with the wide variety of dance styles, made Season 31 a notable installment in the *Dancing with the Stars* franchise, demonstrating the enduring appeal and emotional depth of the competition.

# Reception

Dancing with the Stars Season 31 experienced a mix of excitement and challenges, particularly in terms of viewership and critical reception. The season was highlighted by various themed nights and emotional performances, including Dedicated Dance Night, which showcased the remaining nine couples in a series of heartfelt routines[29]. However, the season faced significant hurdles with declining ratings, mirroring trends seen across many broadcast reality shows in recent years.

## Viewership Trends

The show's ratings have been on a downward trajectory for several seasons, a trend exacerbated by the increasing popularity of streaming platforms and the evolving media landscape[6]. For example, during Tom Bergeron's final seasons on the show, viewership decreased from an average of 10.52 million viewers per episode in Season 23 (2016) to 6.74 million viewers in Season 28[37]. As of November 2023, the audience for Season 31 averaged 6,364,000 viewers, which indicated a slight uptick of 23% from the previous week but remained below historical highs[6][7].

## Critical Reception

While individual performances drew praise, particularly standout routines like Trevor Donovan and Daniel Durant's emotional dance during '90s Night[10], the overall reception highlighted concerns about the season's talent pool and engagement levels[22]. Critics noted that the production's focus seemed to shift toward providing contestants with memorable experiences rather than directly addressing the audience's waning interest in the show[10]. Despite the challenges, the creative presentation of themed nights and impressive choreography continued to captivate audiences, fostering a sense of nostalgia and entertainment that kept some viewers engaged[38].

# Awards and Nominations

## Emmy Awards

Dancing with the Stars has received numerous accolades since its inception, particularly at the Emmy Awards. Over the years, the show has garnered a total of 13 Emmy nominations, with Derek Hough, a prominent dancer and choreographer, contributing significantly to its success. All but two of Hough's nominations stem from his work on the show, where he has won the Emmy six times, each with different partners[39][40].
The program has been recognized in various categories, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and Outstanding Choreography, affirming its impact on the television landscape. Notably, the show has won the Emmy for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program multiple times, reflecting its popularity and excellence in production[41][40].

## Other Awards

In addition to its Emmy achievements, Dancing with the Stars has been celebrated with a variety of other awards.
