## Geological Context  

### Tectonic Background  

Java is located near an **active convergent boundary** between the **Sunda Plate** (north) and the **Australian Plate** (south). At this **subduction zone**, the **Australian Plate moves northward**, sinking beneath the **Sunda Plate** at the **Java Trench**, making the region highly prone to **earthquakes and tsunamis**.  

### Fault Activity  

The **2022 West Java earthquake** is believed to be associated with the **Cimandiri Fault or Padalarang Fault**, both known for causing **strike-slip faulting**.  

- The **Cimandiri Fault** runs for **100 km (62 miles)**, stretching from **Palabuhanratu Bay** to **Cianjur**.  
- It has a **history of generating significant earthquakes**, including past events in **2006 and 1994**.
