## **The Collision: How It Happened**

### **Sequence of Events**

At around **7:00 PM IST on June 2, 2023**, the **Coromandel Express (12841)**, traveling from **Shalimar (West Bengal) to Chennai (Tamil Nadu),** derailed near **Bahanaga Bazar railway station** in Balasore district. The train, running at full speed (around **128 km/h**), accidentally entered a loop line where a stationary **freight train** was parked. The **collision with the freight train** caused multiple coaches to derail and land on adjacent tracks.

Just minutes later, the **Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express (12864)**, traveling in the opposite direction on the adjacent track, **crashed into the derailed coaches** of the Coromandel Express, resulting in further devastation.

### **Key Factors Leading to the Collision**
1. **Signal Error or Interlocking System Failure**
   - The preliminary investigation suggested that **a signaling error may have caused the Coromandel Express to switch to the loop line**, where the freight train was stationed.
   - The **electronic interlocking system**, which prevents such conflicts, may have failed or been incorrectly operated.

2. **High-Speed Impact**
   - The Coromandel Express was traveling at around **128 km/h**, giving the driver little time to react.
   - The force of the impact led to the derailment of multiple coaches.

3. **Chain Reaction with the Second Train**
   - Some of the derailed coaches from the first collision **spilled onto the adjacent main track**.
   - The Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express, moving at high speed, crashed into these wreckage pieces, **further worsening the destruction**.

## **Investigation and Cause of the Disaster**

### **Preliminary Findings**

The **Indian Railways' investigation**, along with a separate inquiry by the **Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS),** identified the following key factors:

1. **Signaling System Failure**
   - The Coromandel Express was supposed to travel on the **main line**, but **due to an error, it was wrongly directed to the loop line**, where the freight train was parked.
   - The failure of the **electronic interlocking system** may have been due to a technical fault or manual error.

2. **Human Error or Sabotage?**
   - Officials initially explored the possibility of **human error**, including whether a **signal was changed incorrectly**.
   - Some reports suggested potential **tampering with railway equipment**, raising concerns about **sabotage or cyber interference**.

3. **Railway Safety Lapses**
   - Despite previous recommendations to modernize railway safety mechanisms, **many trains in India still rely on outdated systems**.

### **Government Actions Post Investigation**

- **The Railway Ministry ordered a high-level probe** into the accident.
- Compensation was announced:
  - ₹10 lakh ($12,000) for families of the deceased.
  - ₹2 lakh ($2,400) for severely injured victims.
- **Suspension of railway staff members** responsible for interlocking system operations.
