## II. Background on SpaceX Starship

### A. Technical Specifications of Starship

The Starship spacecraft is a marvel of modern engineering, designed to be fully reusable to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. It consists of two main components: the Starship spacecraft itself and the Super Heavy booster. The spacecraft is approximately 50 meters tall with a diameter of 9 meters and is capable of carrying over 100 metric tons to low Earth orbit. The Super Heavy booster, which is about 70 meters tall, is designed to propel the Starship out of Earth's atmosphere. Together, they form a system that is not only powerful but also versatile, capable of landing on a variety of surfaces thanks to its robust landing legs and heat shield necessary for re-entry.

### B. Development Timeline

The development of the Starship program has been a journey of incremental progress marked by significant milestones. Beginning with early conceptual designs in the early 2010s, SpaceX has iteratively tested and refined its approach through a series of prototypes. From the initial "Starhopper" tests to the more recent high-altitude flights, each phase has been critical in advancing the program. These tests have provided valuable data on the spacecraft's aerodynamics, control systems, and engine performance, leading up to the integrated flight test.

### C. Previous Tests and Achievements

Previous tests of the Starship program have included a series of increasingly complex prototypes. Notable flights include the high-altitude tests of SN8, SN9, and SN10, each providing critical insights despite ending in explosive landings. These tests have demonstrated SpaceX's iterative approach to development, where each prototype builds on the lessons learned from its predecessors. Achievements such as the successful landing of the SN15 prototype have marked significant milestones, showcasing the program's rapid progress and adaptability.
