## II. Background Information

### A. Historical Flooding in Emilia-Romagna

#### 1. Past Flood Events

Emilia-Romagna has experienced flooding throughout its history, with notable events recorded in the 19th and 20th centuries. The floods of 1966 were particularly devastating, prompting significant infrastructure improvements. However, the scale of the 2023 floods surpassed these historical precedents.

#### 2. Changes in Flood Patterns Over the Years

Over the decades, changes in flood patterns have been observed, attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Increased urbanization and changes in land use have altered natural water drainage, exacerbating flood risks.

### B. Climate and Weather Patterns

#### 1. Typical Weather Conditions in the Region

The region typically experiences a temperate climate, with hot summers and cold, wet winters. Spring and autumn are usually mild, but recent years have seen shifts in weather patterns, with unseasonal rainfall becoming more common.

#### 2. Recent Changes and Trends Leading Up to 2023

Leading up to 2023, meteorologists noted an increase in extreme weather events. Climate change has been identified as a significant driver of these changes, with rising temperatures contributing to more intense and frequent rainfalls.

## III. Causes of the 2023 Floods

### A. Natural Causes

#### 1. Weather Conditions Leading to the Floods

The region experienced an unusual concentration of rain in a short period, which overwhelmed the capacity of rivers and drainage systems. This anomalous weather pattern was attributed to a stagnant low-pressure system that drew moist air from the Mediterranean Sea.

#### 2. Role of Climate Change

Climate change has intensified the water cycle, leading to more severe weather events. Scientific studies suggest that the increased frequency of heavy rainfall in Emilia-Romagna is linked to global warming, which causes more moisture to be held in the atmosphere.

### B. Human Contributions

#### 1. Urbanization and Land Use

Rapid urbanization in Emilia-Romagna has led to the reduction of natural water absorption areas. Cities have expanded into floodplains, and agricultural practices have changed land use, reducing the land's ability to absorb rainwater effectively.

#### 2. Infrastructure and Drainage Systems

The region's infrastructure was not equipped to handle such a large-scale flood. Aging drainage systems and insufficient flood defenses were unable to cope with the volume of water, highlighting the need for modernization and adaptation to new climate realities.

### C. Scientific Analysis

#### 1. Hydrological Studies

Hydrological studies conducted after the floods point to a combination of saturated soils and overbank flow as primary causes. The soil, already saturated from previous rain, could not absorb the new rainfall, causing rapid runoff into rivers.

#### 2. Expert Opinions and Predictions

Experts predict that without significant changes in policy and infrastructure, such events may become more common. They emphasize the need for improved flood management strategies and climate adaptation measures.

## IV. The Impact of the Floods

### A. Humanitarian Impact

#### 1. Displacement of Residents

The floods displaced over 10,000 residents, forcing them into temporary shelters. The disruption of communities was profound, with many losing their homes and livelihoods.

#### 2. Casualties and Injuries

Sadly, the floods resulted in over 20 fatalities and numerous injuries. The rapid rise of floodwaters caught many off guard, underscoring the need for better early warning systems.

#### 3. Psychological and Social Effects

The psychological toll on affected populations is considerable. The trauma of losing homes and loved ones, coupled with the uncertainty of the future, has left lasting scars.

### B. Economic Consequences
