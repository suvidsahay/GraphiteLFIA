## The Incident

### Chronology of Events

The flight took off from Kunming at approximately 1:10 PM local time. The initial phase of the journey proceeded without incident, with the aircraft climbing to its cruising altitude. However, about an hour into the flight, the aircraft suddenly began a rapid descent. Communication with air traffic control was lost, and no distress signals were sent from the cockpit. The aircraft crashed in a mountainous area near the city of Wuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, at around 2:22 PM.

### Crash Site Description

The crash site was located in a remote, forested area characterized by rugged terrain and dense vegetation. The impact resulted in a large debris field, complicating the efforts of emergency responders. Rescue teams faced significant challenges accessing the site, but they promptly initiated search and recovery operations upon arrival.

## Investigation and Analysis

### Initial Response and Investigation

The investigation into the crash of Flight 5735 was led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), with assistance from international aviation experts, including representatives from Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
