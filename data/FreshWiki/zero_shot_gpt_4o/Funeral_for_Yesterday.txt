## III. The Psychological Aspect

Humans have a natural tendency to cling to memories, which are integral to identity and personal history. Psychological theories suggest that memories, whether pleasant or traumatic, shape our perceptions and behaviors.

Additionally, trauma can lead to an inability to let go, trapping individuals in a cycle of reliving past events.
