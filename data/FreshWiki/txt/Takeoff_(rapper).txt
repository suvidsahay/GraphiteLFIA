Kirsnick Khari Ball (June 18, 1994 – November 1, 2022), known professionally as Takeoff, was an American rapper.

The group scored multiple top-10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including "MotorSport" (featuring Nicki Minaj and Cardi B), "Stir Fry", "Walk It Talk It" (featuring Drake), and "Bad and Boujee" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert), the latter of which peaked at the top of the chart.

# Early life

Kirsnick Khari Ball was born on June 18, 1994,  in Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he was also raised by his mother, along with family members Quavo and Offset [1]. He started making beats and developing rhythms in the seventh grade, but did not start producing music professionally until 2011 [9] [10] [11]. 

# Career

## 2008–2018: Early work with Migos

Along with fellow family members Quavo and Offset, Takeoff began rapping in 2008. The group initially performed under the stage name Polo Club, but eventually changed their name to Migos. The group released their first full-length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011. They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012. Migos initially rose to prominence after the release of their single "Versace", in 2013. The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Their debut studio album, Yung Rich Nation, was released in July 2015, and featured guest appearances from Chris Brown and Young Thug, and production from Zaytoven and Murda Beatz [48]. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200 [15]. Migos achieved their first number one single in 2016 with "Bad and Boujee" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert), peaking on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of January 21, 2017. The song has gone on to be certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). While he can be seen in one of the background scenes in the music video, Takeoff is not featured nor credited on the song. Takeoff claimed that he was not featured on the song because he was busy at the time of recording. During filming of Complex's Everyday Struggle at the BET Awards 2017, he was questioned about his absence by hosts Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks, to which he replied, "Do it look like I'm left off 'Bad and Boujee'?". Takeoff's response caused Budden to leave the set, and an altercation between Migos and Budden and their entourages almost took place before it was broken up by security [17]. Migos' second studio album, Culture, was released on January 27, 2017, debuting at number 1 on the US Billboard 200, moving 131,000 album-equivalent units, including 44,000 copies sold, during its first week of release. The album went on to achieve platinum certification in the country in July 2017. The group's third album, Culture II, was released on January 26, 2018 [20] [21]. It became Migos' second album to debut at number 1 on the Billboard 200, moving 199,000 equivalent units, including 38,000 copies sold, in its first week of release [22] [23]. 

## 2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work

Following the release of Culture II, on October 23, 2018, Takeoff announced an upcoming solo project titled The Last Rocket to be released the following month. Two days after the announcement, he released his first single off the album, "Last Memory", along with the music video [25]. The album was released on November 2, 2018 [26]. The fourth Migos album, Culture III, was released on June 11, 2021. This would be the final Migos album released during Takeoff's lifetime. [28]. 

## 2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links

In October 2022, rumors surrounding a possible disbandment of Migos arose,  based on reports that Quavo's ex-girlfriend Saweetie had slept with Offset [29]. Following this, Quavo and Takeoff released a collaborative album titled Only Built for Infinity Links on October 7, 2022,  25 days before Takeoff's death. [30] [31]. 

# Legal issues

## Georgia Southern University incident

On April 18, 2015, Migos were scheduled to headline Georgia Southern University's 2015 Spring concert at Hanner Fieldhouse. The show started at 7:00 p.m. with local opening acts; however, the group took to the stage nearly an hour and a half later than their scheduled 9:00 p.m. set time. Although their performance contract stipulated a minimum 45-minute set length, the group performed for less than 30 minutes before leaving the stage. The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the Bulloch County Sheriff's Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group's vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons. While university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group were allowed to perform as the student body had voted to have the group perform among seven acts that were up for consideration, and student fees and ticket sales were used to pay for the concert. According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000 [34]. University officials initially sought to put Migos in breach of contract due to the group's late arrival, shortened performance, and possession of contraband on university property; however, the university ultimately paid half of the agreed-upon fees. On April 20, 2015, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of their entourage were released on bond by the Bulloch County District Attorney's Office while Offset and six others remained in custody without bond. As a result of their arrests, on April 28, 2015, Migos announced they would postpone their Yung Rich Nation Tour until July. 

## Sexual assault allegations

On August 5, 2020, news broke that Takeoff was named as the perpetrator in a civil lawsuit filed by a female victim on charges of "sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and interference with civil rights" at a June 2020 party in Los Angeles. As of April 2, 2021, [update] it was reported that the Los Angeles District Attorney's office would not be filing criminal charges against Takeoff due to insufficient evidence [38] [39] [40]. The civil suit court proceedings were still in progress as of April 2021. [update] [41] [42] [43].
