# Background

## Location and date

At the Miss Grand International 2021 pageant, Matthew Deane, the host of the event announced that the 10th edition of the pageant will happen in Indonesia on 25 October 2022,    with pre-pageant activities in Bali,  and the coronation night in Jakarta [7] [8] [9] [1]. The event was supported by the Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia, Sandiaga Uno [10]. After a venue selection survey conducted by the Dunia Mega Bintang Foundation, licensee of Miss Grand Indonesia in mid-May, the organization announced that the coronation night of Miss Grand International 2022 pageant will take place at Sentul International Convention Center. Furthermore, the SICC also served as the location for the national costume parade and the preliminary competition [12]. The organization later disclosed that Le Méridien Jakarta and Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa will serve as accommodation for the delegates during the pageant activities in Jakarta and Bali, respectively [12]. Gianyar's Bali Safari and Marine Park was also announced as the venue of the Balinese costume presentation [13]. 

## Selection of participants

Contestants from sixty-eight countries and territories have been selected to compete in the competition. Thirty-seven of these delegates were appointed to the position after being a runner-up of their national pageant or being selected through a casting process. 

### Replacements

Chiara Vanderveeren, a contestant of the Miss Grand Belgium 2022 pageant, was appointed as the replacement for Miss Grand Belgium 2022 Alyssa Gilliaert, who resigned due to medical conditions. Camila Sanabria, Miss Supranational Bolivia 2023, was appointed as Miss Grand Bolivia 2022 due to Alondra Mercado's renouncement of the title [64]. Fabien Laurencio, first runner-up at Nuestra Belleza Latina 2021, was appointed as Miss Grand Cuba 2022, as Daniela Espinosa renounced her title due to undisclosed reasons [17]. Lisseth Naranjo, a former Miss Grand Ecuador who resigned from the title in 2020, was designated as the replacement for Emilia Vásquez, Miss Grand Ecuador 2022, who withdrew due to undisclosed reasons [18]. Laura de Sanctis, Miss Universe Panamá 2017 was designated Miss Grand Panamá 2022 by a new Miss Grand Panama licensee [19] [20]. Originally, Katheryn Yejas was named Miss Grand Panamá 2022 but was later ostracized due to the change of license holder [21]. Luiseth Materán, Miss Universe Venezuela 2021, was appointed to the position after the original representative, Sabrina Deraneck, resigned from the title within a month after being crowned [103]. An internal conflict in the licensee team between Orlando Ruiz, a founder of the Concurso Nacional de Belleza México (CNB México) who also served as the general director of Miss Grand México, and Flavio Falsiroli, Miss Grand México national director, caused Orlando Ruiz to depart from the team and his affiliated candidate, Jessica Farjat, who was previously set to represent the country at Miss Grand International 2022, also resigned from the title. Laysha Salazar was then elected as the replacement [25]. 

### Debuts, returns, and withdrawals

In this 2022 edition, three countries were expected to make their debuts,  but two withdrew for unspecified reasons even though their representatives had already been determined; six countries that competed in the 2021 edition withdrew due to a lack of a national licensee, and 15 countries returned to the competition after being absent in the previous editions [27]. Initially, seventy-two countries and territories franchises confirmed that they would send their candidates to Indonesia; however, representatives from Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, withdrew before the pageant started,  while the representative from Kosovo withdrew due to health problems at the fourth day of the pre-final activities [28]. 

## Controversies

On October 3, the pageant organizer revealed all the roommate pairing lists of Miss Grand International 2022 candidates in a live video streamed on the pageant's official Facebook page, in which the Russian and Ukrainian candidates were paired as roommates amid the ongoing war between the two countries. The issue has sparked an overwrought discussion on many social media sites because of the tense political situation between the two countries over the past few months,  Some accused the organizer of attempting to profit from the conflict by pairing the two contestants on purpose to make the contest viral and demanded the organizer adjust the room sharing situation, while others advised thinking optimistically and that the beauty competition had nothing to do with the war [33] [34]. However, even though the representative from Russia, Ekaterina Astashenkova, has stated through social media that there is no problem staying together with the Ukrainian representatives during the contest, the Ukrainian representative, Olga Vasyliv, denied doing so and also called for removing Russia from the competition. 

# Results

# Pre-pageant events

## Pre-arrival voting

As previously done since 2018, pre-arrival voting on the organizer's Facebook and Instagram pages was launched a week before the advent of the candidates. Ten contestants with the most scores calculated by the number of likes and shares on their portrait photos acquired the authority to be present at the exclusive dinner with the pageant president, Nawat Itsaragrisil, which happened after the welcome ceremony at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa on October 5 [39] [40] [41]. 

## Country's Power of the Year challenge

The Country's Power of the Year award returned after being introduced for the first time in 2020,  with fans able to vote for delegates to advance to the Top 20 through Instagram [44]. All candidates were divided into ten groups for the challenge. The voting took place on the pageant's Instagram account, where the photos to vote for was presented for one group per day. The winner of each group advanced to the second round where all ten qualified contestants were randomly grouped into two groups of five [45]. Then, the voting took place to elect the two winners of each group to advance into the final round [46]. The winner of the Country's Power of the Year challenge will automatically be part of the Top 20 [47]. 

## Sportswear and swimsuit competition

Since Indonesia is a Muslim country, appearing in a swimsuit in public violates religious tenets requiring women to dress modestly. Because of this, the swimsuit event was held as a private event at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, where no physical audience was allowed but was broadcast online except for the host country [50]. Indonesian swimwear label called Niconico was used in this event [50]. The swimsuit competition was replaced by the sportswear competition at the preliminary and final competitions [50]. The sportswear competition took place on 9 October at the Bebek Tepi Sawah Restaurant and Villas in Ubud, Bali,  in which 68 aspirants wore sportswear designed by Indonesian designers, Didiet Maulana and the Iwan Tirta Batik team [51] [52]. For the Best in Swimsuit award, ten candidates were chosen by the public vote on the pageant's Facebook page, and the other ten were chosen by the panel of judges; the number of each group was then minimized to five. The winner was expected to be announced at the final competition, but was not elected. [48]. 

# Pageant

## Format

From twenty-one on the previous edition, twenty semi-finalists were selected to continue in the competition. The results of the preliminary competition — which consisted of the swimsuit competition, the evening gown competition, the closed-door interviews, and other pageant activities determine the nineteen semifinalists who will advance for the first cut. The Country of the Year award, determined through public voting, was reinstated after being introduced in 2020; the winner of which will complete the twenty semi-finalists [55]. The twenty semi-finalists competed at the sportswear competition.. Eventually, nine semi-finalists, including the winner of the Miss Popular vote which was determined through public voting, completed the ten semi-finalists that will compete at the long gown, and speech competitions. Afterward, the five finalists were chosen [56] [57]. The remainder of the top ten were enthroned as fifth runners-up on the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the pageant.
