Hurricane_Idalia

Hurricane Idalia was a powerful and destructive Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage across parts of the southeastern United States, especially in North Florida, in late August 2023. The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Idalia formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development ensued as it meandered in the western part of the Caribbean Sea; the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 26, 2023, and strengthened into a tropical storm a day later, receiving the name Idalia. It traversed the Gulf of Mexico where it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category 4 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category 3 strength on August 30. Idalia remained a hurricane as it moved through Northern Florida and crossed into Southeast Georgia; it then pushed into the Carolinas as a tropical storm. On August 31, Idalia emerged into the Atlantic, where it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Later, it passed south of Bermuda, made a counterclockwise loop, then meandered off the coast of Nova Scotia while winding down.
Idalia caused significant damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure along its inland path, primarily in Florida, where winds and the resulting floodwaters were highest. Its storm surge was record-breaking from the Big Bend region south to Tampa Bay. The system also spawned a tornado outbreak with around 12 confirmed tornadoes. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida's Big Bend region since the 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane. Four people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. Early estimates placed insured losses at $2.2–5 billion. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in several additional deaths and numerous rescues.

# Meteorological history

On August 24, 2023, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast. The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin the following day, and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea [3]. The pace of organization quickened on August 26, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula, and at 21:00 UTC it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten. Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counterclockwise loop . The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15 UTC on August 27, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40 mph (65 km/h) [5] [6]. Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward  toward the Yucatán Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way despite being impacted by moderate northwesterly wind shear [7] [8]. By 09:00 UTC on August 29, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, Idalia had developed an inner core and almost complete eyewall and the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane. Later that day, Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 strength  as it benefited from exceptional conditions, with sea-surface temperatures of 88 °F (31 °C), generally low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels [10] [11]. Idalia continued to rapidly intensify as it accelerated northward off the Florida Suncoast and approached the Big Bend region, reaching its peak intensity of Category 4 strength on the morning of August 30, a few hours prior to landfall, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg) [12]. This marked a wind increase of 55 mph (89 km/h) during the 24 hour period ending at 09:00 UTC on August 30, making it one of fastest rates of tropical cyclone intensification ever observed in the Atlantic basin 24 hours before landfall [13]. At its peak, the NHC described the system as having "a small eye surrounded by very cold clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant."  Idalia's intensification was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly prior to landfall [14]. Idalia made landfall at 11:45 UTC, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Perry, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 949 mbar (28.02 inHg) [15]. The system quickly weakened inland as it pushed through North Florida, becoming a tropical storm later that day after crossing into Georgia. Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on the morning of August 31 [17] [18]. That afternoon, Idalia transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina [19]. As the storm moved to the east-southeast the following day, light wind shear along its path enabled the system to maintain its structure and intensity despite the lack of convection [20]. The storm impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September 2, as it passed just to the south [21]. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert on September 4  and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days, before dissipating on September 8 [22]. 

# Preparations

## Cuba

More than 10,000 people were evacuated from Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. Patients in Bahía Honda were evacuated to a local clinic after fearing flooding [24]. 

## United States

On August 31, 2023, President Joe Biden said that he had spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other governors about Idalia and that he had approved of their requests for disaster and emergency declarations. 

### Florida

On August 30, Governor Ron DeSantis visited Perry and gave a press conference update on the state's response to the storm, where he spoke alongside several state and local officials. President Biden announced that he had directed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to fly to Florida and meet with DeSantis and that up to 1,500 federal personnel as well as 900 members of the Coast Guard were being sent to respond to the hurricane's impacts [115]. On September 2, President Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, landed at Gainesville Regional Airport before embarking on an aerial tour of affected areas within the state. Biden then visited Suwannee Pineview Elementary School in Live Oak where he was briefed on the damage caused by the storm. Biden met with residents of Live Oak as well as Live Oak Mayor Frank Davis and Senator Rick Scott among other officials. FEMA opened up six temporary Disaster and Recovery Centers across Dixie, Levy, Hamilton, Suwannee, Madison, and Lafayette counties. Fourteen counties; Citrus, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Hernando, Jefferson, Lafayette, Levy, Madison, Pasco, Pinellas, Suwannee, and Taylor, were made eligible for Individual, Critical Needs, Clean and Sanitize, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance [119]. The Small Business Administration made available Business Physical Disaster, Economic Injury Disaster, and Home Disaster loans available to Citrus, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Hernando, Jefferson, Lafayette, Levy, Madison, Pasco, Pinellas, Suwannee, and Taylor counties. Meanwhile, Alachua, Baker, Hillsborough, Leon, Marion, Polk, Sumter, Union, and Wakulla counties were only eligible for Economic Injury Disaster loans. 

### Elsewhere

Rip currents produced by the remnants of Idalia across the Eastern United States resulted in numerous rescues. Beaches were packed with people enjoying the Labor Day Weekend. One person drowned off Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on September 3. At least a dozen people required rescue along the New Jersey coast [77]. Three people died in the state on September 4: one in Beach Haven, one in Belmar, and the third in Seaside Heights. Idalia was also associated with an unusual movement of American Flamingos, with an large number of flamingos seen in Florida, and flamingos seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

## Bermuda

On September 2, the Department of Marine and Ports Services announced that ferries were suspended until weather conditions improved, BELCO announced that Idalia had caused over 6,000 power outages, and the Department of Public Transportation announced the temporary suspension of bus services. Idalia also caused all flights to and from L.F [112]. Wade International Airport and North America to be cancelled or delayed on September 2, with some flights also being affected the following day. 

# Impact

## Caribbean

The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula. As Idalia became a tropical storm, Cayman Islands were lashed with rough seas  and strong winds [60] [61]. Owen Roberts International Airport had recorded a peak wind gust of 35 mph (56 km/h). Idalia also brought heavy rain, reaching up to 2 inches (51 mm) causing some flooding. [citation needed] Flooding occurred in Güira de Melena and Guanimar in Cuba, and high winds hit Pinar del Río Province. Rainfall reached 4 inches (100 mm) across portions of the country [24] [25].

### Georgia

On September 1, Governor Brian Kemp toured Valdosta with Georgia First Lady Marty Kemp and other state officials to survey damage from Idalia. While in Valdosta, Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency Director Chris Stallings announced that the state had requested federal assistance from FEMA for the clean-up efforts within the state. The SBA declared Cook, Glynn, and Lowndes counties eligible for Physical and Economic Injury Disaster Loans due being approved federal disaster relief funds from FEMA due to President Biden approving a major disaster declaration for the counties, which also made those counties eligible for Individual and Public Assistance from FEMA. Meanwhile, Berrien, Brooks, Camden, Colquitt, Echols, Lanier, McIntosh, Tift, and Wayne counties were made eligible to apply only for Economic Injury Disaster Loans [122] [123]. The United States Department of Agriculture has also approved of financial aid to farmers in Berrien County with crop damage [124]. 

### South Carolina

A very brief EF0 tornado in Goose Creek flipped a car on US 52, injuring two people. Four other tornadoes struck the state as well [97] [100]. An EF1 tornado struck a wooded area northeast of Turbeville, while an EF0 tornado moved southeast through Mount Pleasant, causing minor damage and crossed over Wando High School. The Francis Marion National Forest was struck by an EF1 tornado which left trees uprooted and snapped [101] [102]. In North Myrtle Beach, a waterspout came ashore as an EF0 tornado and caused damage to a neighborhood [103] [97]. Storm surge breached The Battery, a historical defensive seawall and promenade in Charleston, causing flooding in the downtown [104]. Further south down the coast in Edisto Beach, a dune was also breached by storm surge, causing flooding within the town. Beginning on September 3, heavy rains from Idalia in the Midlands began flooding low-lying areas along the Edisto and Combahee rivers in Colleton and Dorchester counties, with water levels peaking at 14.5 feet (4.4 m) at a river gauge at Givhans Ferry State Park. The flooding caused one person to be rescued from a home in Givhans [106]. 

### North Carolina

Three tornadoes struck the state. An EF0 tornado damaged a veterinary hospital and two other buildings in St. James. An EF1 tornado struck a wooded area in Old Town, while in Myrtle Grove, a waterspout moved ashore and became an EF1 tornado, damaging two buildings and causing a tree to fall on an SUV, injuring the driver. One person drowned due to rip currents along the coast of Avon on September 4 [109].
