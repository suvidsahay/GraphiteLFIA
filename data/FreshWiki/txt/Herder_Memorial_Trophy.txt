Herder_Memorial_Trophy

The Herder Memorial Trophy, or Herder, is the championship trophy to be awarded annually to the senior ice hockey champions of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The original cast silver trophy was donated in 1935 by The Evening Telegram newspaper on behalf of the Herder family, as a memorial to five brothers who played hockey in St. John's.
Since the 1934–35 season, the trophy has been awarded 84 times. The Herder was not awarded in 1942, 1943, 1991, 2020 and 2021. The first winners of the Herder trophy was a team from Corner Brook that won the inaugural all-Newfoundland ice hockey championship on March 22, 1935. Teams from St. John's (St. Bon's, St. John's Capitals) have won the Herder Trophy 19 times. The most recent winners were the Southern Shore Breakers on April 23, 2023.

# History

As the game of hockey developed across the island, and hockey teams started to travel and compete in regional championships, the idea of a competition to decide the ice hockey champions of Newfoundland gained momentum in early 1935. During a meeting of the St. John's Hockey League on March 5, 1935, it was announced that a trophy, for a championship competition, was to be donated by The Evening Telegram newspaper to be perpetually awarded to Newfoundland's best hockey team. The Herder would become emblematic of ice hockey supremacy in Newfoundland and Labrador.The Evening Telegram was published by a member of the Herder family since the founding of the paper in 1879 up until the retirement of Stephen Herder in 1993 . Telegram has played an integral role in the promotion and sponsorship of the Herder Championships.. The inaugural all-Newfoundland championships took place in St. John's at the Prince of Wales Rink on March 21 and 22, 1935 between Corner Brook, the western hockey champions, and the Guards from the St. John's Senior League that won the Avalon hockey championship. This was the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Newfoundland hockey . The winning team would have the distinction of being the first holder of the Herder Memorial Trophy.. The St. John's Guards earned the right to represent the Avalon Peninsula by first defeating St. Bon's in a 2-game series to become St. John's city champions, and then by toppling the Bay Roberts Rovers in a 2-game, total goal series. The All-Newfoundland championship match-up was then set; the Guards of St. John's would play host to the Corner Brook All-Star Team. Fans in St. John's eagerly awaited the arrival of the Corner Brook team. Tickets to the 2 games were sold out quickly. Corner Brook edged the Guards 1–0 in Game 1, and wAS victorious in Game 2 by a 4–2 margin to become the island's top team, and first Herder Trophy Champions.. The Herder trophy was the brainchild of Ralph Herder, then president of The Evening Telegram. The trophy was a memorial to his five late brothers, Arthur, William, Douglas, Augustus and Hubert, who were all avid hockey players in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.. Originally donated on behalf of Ralph Herder in memory of five of his late brothers, the trophy now honors the memory of seven brothers, including Ralph and his youngest brother James. In 2009, the name of Ralph's son Stephen was added to the trophy. All seven Herder brothers were fine hockey players and often played together, with four of them sometimes playing together on a championship team. James Herder coached the 1935 Guards team that lost the inaugural Herder championship to Corner Brook in March 1935.. 

# The Herder family

William James Herder, born in Old Perlican, was the founder of Newfoundland's first daily newspaper, The Evening Telegram. Ralph, one of William's seven sons, became publisher of the Telegram in 1934 after the death of Augustus (Gus), who was the fifth brother to pass away. Ralph donated the Herder Trophy on behalf of the Herder Family as a memorial to his five late brothers (Douglas, Arthur, Hubert, Herbert Augustus (Gus) and William Jr.). Later the names of Ralph, his youngest brother James, and Ralph's son Stephen were added to the trophy.. The Herder is now a memorial to the following Herder family members:. 

# The trophy

An announcement was made on March 5, 1935, at a St. John's Hockey League meeting that the Evening Telegram, on behalf of the Herder family, will donate a trophy to be awarded to the winners of an all-Newfoundland hockey championship. The trophy would not be available for the 1935 championship but arrived in St . John's from the manufacturer six months later and was sent to Corner Brook to be presented to the winning team. The Herder consisted of a cast-silver hockey player mounted on an ebony base. St. Bon's star Edward "Key" Kennedy (1911-1955) was the model for the hockey player that stands atop the original trophy. Trophy-donor Ralph Herder brought a photo of Kennedy in a hockey pose to New York where the model was made and a figure was cast in silver. Beginning in 1947 metal shields engraved with the names of winning teams were fixed to the base. In 1952 a second tier was added, third and fourth tiers in 1960, and three more tiers before the original trophy was retired in 2007.. The original Herder was retired in 2007 is on display in the Newfoundland & Labrador Hockey Hall of Fame located at the Corner Brook Civic Centre. Since 2007 a replica has been awarded to the championship teams.. 

# Conditions placed by the trophy donor

The Herder family attached eight conditions to their donation of the Herder Memorial Trophy to govern competition for the all-Newfoundland amateur hockey championship: . 

## Exceptions to the original conditions

### Condition #2

From 1935 though 1941 the All-Newfoundland finals were played at the former Prince's Rink in St. John's (renamed The Arena in 1937). The Herder championships were cancelled for 1942 and 1943 after the Arena was destroyed by fire on November 28, 1941, and due to depleted rosters of senior hockey teams with men serving overseas during the Second World War. After the Arena burned down in November 1941, St. John's did not have a suitable venue until the opening of Memorial Stadium in December 1954. In 1944, the Herder finals were held outside St. John's for the first time when Bell Island and Corner Brook played the all-Newfoundland final series at the Corner Brook rink. The NAHA was granted permission by Ralph Herder to hold the Herder finals outside the capital city for the first time. Since 1944 condition #2 has not been enforced and the Herder Finals location has been decided by NAHA and typically held in the arenas of the competing teams.. In recent years, the Herder finals series was held at Mile One Centre (and before it was built, at Memorial Stadium) in St. John's and frequently sold out the 6,000 seat building. Games were also held in the Pepsi Centre in the city of Corner Brook, on the west coast of the island, when teams from that area were playing for the cup.. Since 2013 the Herder finalists have the right to decide the location of their home games.. 

### Condition #4

In 1957 the first exception to condition #4 occurred when the Grand Falls Andcos were awarded the Herder by default. No other senior "A" hockey teams registered for the Herder playoffs that year.. 

### Condition #7

Engraved plates with the names of the winning teams have been affixed to the base of the Herder Trophy since the late 1940s. Beginning in 1952, additional layers have been added to the trophy base as required to accommodate successive Herder Champion nameplates. [10]. 

# Series format

Over the history of the championship series, NAHA has dictated a number of series formats that included the winners of divisional, local league or island-wide league playoffs. The original series featured the eastern champions versus western champions. This format continued until 1962 when an island-wide Newfoundland Senior Hockey league was formed. The champions of the provincial league were awarded the Herder trophy until 1989 when the league was disbanded. Eastern league champions played for the Herder in 1990 and in 1991 there was no Herder Championship.. Between 1991 and 2011, the format of the Herder finals reverted to a competition between the champions of local leagues. The eastern league champions played a western or central league champion in a finals series to decide the top provincial team who were awarded the Herder Trophy.. On February 25, 2015, Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador approved a request by the Central West Senior Hockey League in which they asked to play for the historic Herder Trophy because it was the only operating Senior A hockey league registered in the province.. Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador announced on March 10, 2022, that they will be awarding the Herder Memorial Trophy to the winner of the Avalon East Senior Hockey League finals. For 2023, Hockey NL announced that the champion of the Avalon East Senior Hockey League will face-off against the champion of the West Coast Senior Hockey League in a seven-game series for the Herder Memorial Championship. 

## Series format history

This is a list of Herder championship series formats since 1935.. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against. 

# Herder Champions

# Presentation ceremony and final game results

At the conclusion of the final game in an on-ice ceremony the Herder Memorial Trophy is presented to the captain of the winning team. Traditionally the presenter has been a representative of the trophy donors, from the Herder family or The Evening Telegram, and/or a representative from Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador.. 

# Finals Appearances

In the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by alphabetical order. In the "Years of appearance" column, bold years indicate winning the Herder Trophy Finals.. ^ A. In 1957 the Herder Finals series was not played. Two teams entered the Section 'A' playoffs in 1957 but after Bell Island withdrew before the finals started, NAHA decided to award the Herder Trophy to the Grand Falls Andcos by default.. 

# Cliff Gorman Memorial Award Winners

In 2005 Hockey Newfoundland & Labrador established the Cliff Gorman Memorial Award to be presented annually to the most valuable player (MVP) for his team during the Herder finals series. A native of Prince Edward Island, Cliff was instrumental in promoting hockey in Corner Brook and in Newfoundland and Labrador since moving there in 1955. Cliff Gorman was inducted into the Newfoundland & Labrador Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 in the building category [107].
