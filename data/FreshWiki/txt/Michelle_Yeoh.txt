# Early life and education

Yeoh was born on 6 August 1962 in Ipoh, Perak,  to Janet Yeoh (born 1937) and Yeoh Kian-teik (1926–2014) [17]. Her father was elected as a Senator of Malaysia from 1959 to 1969 (representing Perak's Malaysian Chinese Association),    the Chairman of the Perak Bar Association,  and the founder of "Sri Maju" in 1975, a major intercity coach service in Malaysia and Singapore [18] [19] [20] [18]. Though of Hokkien and Cantonese ancestry,  she grew up speaking English to her father and could understand some Malaysian Cantonese from her maternal grandmother who lived with them [18] [21] [22]. She learned to speak Cantonese fluently in the 1980s and some Mandarin in the 2000s [23]. Despite that, she never learned to read or write Chinese, which she has said was her greatest regret. Yeoh was keen on dance from an early age, beginning ballet at age four. She studied at Main Convent Ipoh, an all-girls secondary school, as a primary student. At age 15, she moved with her parents to the United Kingdom, where she was enrolled in The Hammond School, Chester, where she started to train as a ballet dancer. Yeoh later studied at Hammond School in Chester, majoring in ballet [25] [26]. However, a spinal injury prevented her from becoming a professional ballet dancer, and she shifted her attention to choreography and other arts. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in creative arts with a minor in drama in 1982 [27]. 

# Career

## Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)

In 1983, twenty-year-old Yeoh won the Miss Malaysia World contest. She was Malaysia's representative at the Miss World 1983 pageant in London, where she placed eighteenth [30]. Later that year, she traveled to Australia where she won the 1984 Miss Moomba International pageant [31]. Her first acting work was in a television commercial for Guy Laroche watches with Jackie Chan [32]. This caught the attention of a fledgling Hong Kong film production company, D&B Films [32]. Although she had a passive understanding of the Ipoh Cantonese spoken in her hometown, she could not speak it. During a phone call in Cantonese, she was offered to co-star in a television commercial with a Sing Long, and only realized that was Jackie Chan's Cantonese name when she arrived in the studio. She learned to speak Cantonese as she began her career in Hong Kong [33]. Yeoh began her film career acting in action and martial arts films, in which she performed most of her own stunts. Already with her third credit, Yes, Madam (1985), she was given a main role [34]. She was credited as Michelle Khan in these earlier films [27] [35]. This alias was chosen by D&B Films, who thought it might be more marketable to international and Western audiences. In 1987 Yeoh married Dickson Poon, who headed the D&B Group, and retired from acting.. 

## Return and establishment as action and martial arts star (1992–2001)

Yeoh returned to acting with Police Story 3: Super Cop (1992) after having divorced Poon.

He referred to her as a "female James Bond" in reference to her combat abilities [36]. She wanted to perform her own stunts but was prevented because director Roger Spottiswoode considered it too dangerous. Nevertheless, she performed all of her own fighting scenes. In 1997, she played Soong Ai-ling in the award-winning The Soong Sisters . Yeoh was approached by director Ang Lee to star as Yu Shu Lien in her first Mandarin-language martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). She did not speak Mandarin until the 2000s, and she had to learn the Mandarin lines for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon phonetically. The film was an international success, and earned Yeoh a BAFTA 2000 nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role. .
