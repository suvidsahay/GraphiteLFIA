Eurovision_Song_Contest_2024

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is set to be the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It is scheduled to take place in Malmö, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 2023 contest with the song "Tattoo" by Loreen. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the contest will be held at the Malmö Arena, and will consist of two semi-finals on 7 and 9 May, and a final on 11 May 2024. It will be the third edition of the contest to take place in Malmö, which hosted it in 1992 and 2013, and the seventh in Sweden, which last hosted it in Stockholm in 2016.

# Location

The 2024 contest will take place in Malmö, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 2023 edition with the song "Tattoo", performed by Loreen. It will be the seventh time Sweden hosts the contest, having previously done so in 1975, 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, and 2016. The selected venue is the 15,500-seat Malmö Arena, a multi-purpose indoor arena which serves as a venue for handball matches, floorball matches, concerts, and other events, noted for having already hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 2013. 

## Bidding phase

Immediately after Sweden's win in the 2023 contest, the first cities to voice their interest in hosting the 2024 edition were Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, the three largest cities in the country as well as the ones to have previously hosted the contest. Besides these, a number of other cities also expressed their intention to bid in the days that followed the 2023 victory, namely Eskilstuna, Jönköping, Örnsköldsvik, Partille and Sandviken. SVT set a deadline of 12 June 2023 for interested cities to formally apply. Stockholm and Gothenburg officially announced their bids on 7 and 10 June respectively,   followed by Malmö and Örnsköldsvik on 13 June [4] [5] [4]. Shortly before the closing of the application period, SVT revealed that it had received several bids,  later clarifying that they had come from these four cities [6] [7] [8]. Prior to this announcement, Sandviken and Jönköping had already declared to have opted out [9] [10]. On 7 July, Gothenburg and Örnsköldsvik's bids were reported to have been eliminated [11] [12]. Later that day, the EBU and SVT announced Malmö as the host city [13]. Key: †  Host city *  Shortlisted ^  Submitted a bid. 

# Provisional list of participating countries

Eligibility for participation in the Eurovision Song Contest requires a national broadcaster with an active EBU membership capable of receiving the contest via the Eurovision network and broadcasting it live nationwide. The EBU issues invitations to participate in the contest to all members.. For the 2024 contest, eligible countries had until 15 September 2023 to send the EBU confirmation of their participation and until 11 October 2023 to withdraw without facing financial penalties. However, as of 14 November 2023, [update] the list of participating countries had not yet been defined, as opposed to previous years when it was released as early as October [34] [35]. As of November 2023, [update] the following 35 countries have publicly confirmed their intention to participate in 2024. Luxembourg is set to return to the contest 31 years after its last participation in 1993.. 

## Other countries

### Active EBU members

Active EBU member broadcasters in Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Monaco and Slovakia have so far confirmed non-participation prior to the announcement of the participants list by the EBU. 

# Production

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 will be produced by the Swedish national broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). The core team will consist of Ebba Adielsson as chief executive producer, Christel Tholse Willers  [sv] as executive producer in charge of communications, Tobias Åberg as executive in charge of production, Johan Bernhagen as executive line producer, Christer Björkman as contest producer, and Per Blankens  [sv] as TV producer. Additional production personnel will include head of production David Wessén, head of legal Mats Lindgren, head of media Madeleine Sinding-Larsen, and executive assistant Linnea Lopez. Willers, Åberg, Bernhagen, Björkman and Lindgren have previously worked on the 2000, 2013 and/or 2016 contests, in various capacities. Björkman has also produced the American Song Contest (an adaptation of the Eurovision format for the United States) and has been largely involved in Melodifestivalen, the Swedish national final for Eurovision, at which Blankens, Sinding-Larsen and Willers have also worked [119] [120] [121]. Malmö Municipality will contribute 30 million SEK (approximately €2.5 million) to the budget of the contest. 

## Slogan

On 14 November 2023, the EBU and SVT announced that "United by Music", the slogan of the 2023 contest, would be retained for 2024 and future editions. 

# Format

## Semi-final allocation draw

An allocation draw is organised to determine the participating countries' designated semi-final. The semi-finalists are divided over a number of pots, based on historical voting patterns, with the purpose of reducing the chance of "bloc voting" and to increase suspense in the semi-finals. The draw also determines which semi-final each of the automatic qualifiers – host country Sweden and "Big Five" countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) – will vote in and be required to broadcast [124]. The ceremony is expected to be held in January 2024 and to include the passing of the host city insignia from the mayor (or equivalent role) of the previous host city to the one of the next host city  – i.e [125]. from Andrew Lewis, chief executive of the Liverpool City Council, to Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, commissioner of Malmö Municipality.. 

## Proposed changes

A number of changes to the format of the contest have been proposed and/or considered for the 2024 edition. The first discussions on the matter took place at the annual Eurovision Song Contest Workshop, held at the Meistersaal in Berlin, Germany, on 12 September 2023. Decisions as to whether and what changes will be applied are up to the contest's reference group. The rules of the 2024 contest were published on 1 November 2023; no notable changes were made compared to the previous edition [126] [133]. 

### Voting system and rules

After the outcome of the 2023 contest, which saw Sweden win despite Finland's lead in the televoting, sparked controversy among the audience, Norwegian broadcaster NRK started talks with the EBU regarding a potential revision of the jury voting procedure; it has been noted that Norwegian entries in recent years have also been penalised by the juries, particularly in 2019 and 2023, when the country finished in sixth and fifth place overall, respectively, despite coming first in 2019 and third in 2023 with the televote. In an interview, the Norwegian head of delegation Stig Karlsen  [no] discussed the idea of reducing the jury's weight on the final score from the current 49.4% to 40% or 30% [129] [130] [131]. Any changes to the voting system are expected to be officially announced in January 2024 [132] [133] [134]. At the Edinburgh TV Festival in August 2023, the EBU's deputy director-general Jean-Philip de Tender discussed the possibility of banning AI-generated content from the contest in order to preserve human contribution, maintaining that "creativity should come from humans and not from machines". In late September 2023, Carolina Norén, Sveriges Radio's commentator for the contest, revealed that she had resumed talks with executive supervisor Martin Österdahl concerning the qualification system; Norén suggested reviewing the rule whereby the "Big Five" countries directly qualify for the final, proposing to restrict it to only the previous winner and host country, and to require the "Big Five" to compete in the semi-finals. 

### Running time

Host broadcaster SVT is evaluating reducing the runtime of the final by approximately an hour, as it has significantly increased since the introduction of features such as the opening flag parade in 2013 and the split jury/televote system in 2016. 

# Broadcasts

All participating broadcasters may choose to have on-site or remote commentators providing insight and voting information to their local audience. While they must broadcast at least the semi-final they are voting in and the final, most broadcasters air all three shows with different programming plans. In addition, some non-participating broadcasters air the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel provides international live streams with no commentary of all shows.. The following are the broadcasters that have confirmed in whole or in part their broadcasting plans:.
