Typhoon_Hinnamnor

Typhoon Hinnamnor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Henry, was a very large and powerful tropical cyclone that impacted  Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Russia. The eleventh named storm, fourth typhoon, and the 1st super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor originated from a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27 by the JTWC. This area soon formed into Tropical Storm Hinnamnor on the next day. The storm rapidly intensified, and became a typhoon on the August 29. Overnight, Hinnamnor cleared a small eye along with a well-defined CDO, and intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, the first tropical cyclone to do so in 2022.
Hinnanmor then weakened due to undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. However, it re-intensified to a Category 5 super typhoon with a larger eye and CDO south of Okinawa. An increasingly hostile environment caused it to lose its convective features the night of September 1, weakening it down to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. As the storm accelerated northward into the East China Sea, it rebuilt itself throughout the next day, and began intensifying again. The storm gained major status once again on September 4, and headed northeastwards towards Busan. Beginning to weaken for the final time on September 5, the storm made landfall late that day as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and began extratropical transition.
As Hinnamnor approached, many advisories concerning the storm were issued in Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea. The typhoon brought flooding rainfall and powerful winds to Okinawa, and thousands of homes suffered power outages. Heavy rainfall affected northern districts in Taiwan, and a man died in the Philippines due to Hinnamnor's flooding. Hinnamnor made landfall just southeast of Geoje in South Korea, knocking out power for tens of thousands of homes. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for 20 deaths, 1 missing and US$1.81 billion in damage across several countries.

# Meteorological history

On August 27, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) [nb 2]  began monitoring a tropical disturbance about 500 nautical miles (925 km; 575 mi) east-southeast of Iwo Jima. Satellite images indicated that the north and southeast areas were accompanied by deep convection wrapping into the low-level center [7]. At around 00:00 UTC on August 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 3] began monitoring a tropical depression that had developed in the Philippine Sea [7]. Later at 04:00 UTC the same day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for Invest 90W [10]. Beginning to rapidly intensify over warm waters, weak vertical wind shear, and high ocean heat content, the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the name Hinnamnor for the system. A central dense overcast feature and prominent spiral banding, noting its obscure low-level circulation center [12]. Hinnamnor continued to organize and intensified into a severe tropical storm early the next day [13]. Hinnamnor strengthened into a typhoon, making it the fourth typhoon of the season [14]. At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Hinnamnor to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 75 knots (140 km/h; 85 mph). Microwave imaging revealed a small, well-defined microwave eye feature [42]. Rapid intensification occurred on Hinnamnor, and it intensified into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon [42]. Quickly strengthening, the storm quickly grew with Category 4-equivalent winds of 125 knots (230 km/h; 145 mph);  however, there was some curved banding in the 8 nautical miles (15 km; 9.2 mi) diameter eye [17] [18]. At around 15:00 UTC on August 30, the JTWC classified Hinnamnor as a super typhoon [42]. Overnight, Hinnamnor cleared out a small, round eye, and strengthened into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon [42]. At this time, the JTWC estimated winds of 140 knots (260 km/h; 160 mph), with the JMA estimating a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) [42]. Hinnamnor weakened back to Category 4-equivalent super typhoon after beginning an eyewall replacement cycle. Hinnamnor entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, and was named Henry on August 31 [42]. As it headed towards the Ryukyu Islands, Hinnamnor proceeded to reorganize on satellite with an intense CDO forming along with a larger eye [24]. It re-intensified back to a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on September 1,  and, at the same time, Tropical Depression 13W (Gardo) embedded into the wind field with Hinnamnor [25] [42]. Hinnamnor weakened to Category 4-equivalent super typhoon by 09:00 UTC due to elongation of the convective core and cooler sea surface temperatures [27]. Due to northeasterly vertical wind shear, Hinnamnor weakened again to Category 4-equivalent typhoon [42]. Hinnamnor's winds were estimated at just 95 knots (175 km/h; 110 mph), which made it a Category 2-equivalent typhoon on September 2 [42]. At 09:00 UTC, Hinnamnor further weakened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon as it finally began to move north-northwest into the East China Sea [30]. It rebuilt its convective features, and was upgraded to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon once more on September 3 [42]. Hinnamnor later crossed the Southern Ryukyu Islands [42]. Hinnamor then exited the PAR at 01:30 PHT September 4 (17:30 UTC September 3), and the PAGASA issued their final bulletin for the system at 05:00 PHT (21:00 UTC September 3) on the same day [42]. The system re-strengthened again to Category 3-equivalent typhoon as it strengthened, with deep convection becoming more symmetric on September 4. Multispectral animated satellite imagery revealed a 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) surrounded eye around a spiral banding [42]. Hinnamnor continued to be persistent despite dry air intrusion from the west [42]. Its eye slowly became cloud-filled as its circulation wrapped around it [37]. At 21:00 UTC on September 5, the JTWC further downgraded it to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon [42]. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Hinnamnor made landfall just southeast of Geoje, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea [42]. At 03:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it began its transition into an extratropical cyclone, with its frontal structure [42]. Shortly after, the JMA downgraded Hinnamnor to a severe tropical storm [42]. The JMA issued its last advisory on Hinnamnor, and declared it an extratropical low [42]. The low moved northward and last noted in Okhotsk, Russia on September 7 [43].
