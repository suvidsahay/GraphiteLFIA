Funeral_for_Yesterday

Funeral for Yesterday is the fourth studio album by Canadian heavy metal band Kittie, released on February 20, 2007. It was the only album released through the band's own record label, X of Infamy Records, and Merovingian Music (MRV). The album was produced by Jack Ponti, and was recorded at RetroMedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, New Jersey, between July and August 2006. Envisioned as a loose concept album about the band's demise and rebirth following a period of turmoil, the album saw Kittie transition towards a more melodic and accessible sound while retaining some of their heavier sensibilities, and was also noted for its greater use of clean singing than on the band's previous releases. It was the first Kittie album with guitarist Tara McLeod, and only with bassist Trish Doan.  
Funeral for Yesterday debuted at number 101 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling just under 9,000 copies in its first week. Its lead single and title track, "Funeral For Yesterday", became Kittie's biggest radio hit, reaching number 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Reviews were generally favourable, with critics praising Kittie's musical growth on the album; however, its vocals drew mixed reactions. Kittie were disappointed with the album's production and their lack of control over its outcome, and sought to distance themselves from its sound with their subsequent releases. It was the final album Doan performed on before her death in 2017.

# Background

In July 2004, Kittie released its third studio album, Until the End, through Artemis Records. After two tours in support of the album, financial problems within the band would prompt bassist Jennifer Arroyo and guitarist Lisa Marx to leave Kittie in February 2005,     before parting ways with Artemis the following month [2] [3] [4] [5]. Kittie was subsequently put on hiatus by the band's two remaining members, guitarist/vocalist Morgan Lander and drummer Mercedes Lander,  [N 1] who both considered changing careers but decided to keep pursuing music [6] [7] [8]. Morgan said: "There was a lot of sadness and tears, but there was also a lot of creativity . And we ultimately decided that this is where our hearts lie and we couldn't do anything else." [8]. The writing process for Funeral for Yesterday lasted a total of eighteen months. Work on the album began whilst Kittie was still on hiatus,  when Morgan and Mercedes began writing songs together once or twice a week as a form of emotional release [8] [12]. They would work on the music together but come up with their own lyrics separately; Morgan said that "as we were both going through the same scenario,  [it was important] for Mercedes to have a voice" [8] [13]. She also felt that their songs benefitted from the fact they had no label or deadlines to contend with, which gave them more time to hone in their arrangements . After unsuccessfully attempting to shop the music they had written together  to various record labels under the name Sweet Revenge, Morgan and Mercedes began seeking out a new guitarist and bassist for Kittie [8] [14] [15]. Tara McLeod, guitarist of the band Sherry, was recruited in August 2005 by Kittie's manager, David Lander, after he saw one of Sherry's performances in Strathroy-Caradoc, Ontario . Soon after, the band recruited Trish Doan, formerly the lead guitarist of an all-female band called Her, as their new bassist [18]. Kittie's new line-up played their debut gig at Call the Office in their hometown of London, Ontario, on September 29, 2005. In February 2006, Kittie released a digital-only EP, Never Again, through Rock Ridge Music as a teaser release for their next album, featuring the songs "Never Again", "This Too Shall Pass", "Breathe" and the iTunes bonus track "Everything That Could Have Been" [21]. Although all of the lyrics and around half of the music for Funeral for Yesterday was written before they joined the band, Morgan and Mercedes gave  McLeod and Doan the freedom to write whatever they wanted for the album afterwards [22]. McLeod said that although Morgan and Mercedes were the band's primary songwriters on the album, "everybody  [had] equal input" [12] [23]. Material was further developed during band rehearsals and live performances, which allowed the band to "work out the kinks" and bring about new ideas for their songs . 

# Recording and production

Funeral for Yesterday was recorded over the span of six weeks at RetroMedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, New Jersey, the longest time Kittie has spent recording any of their albums. Recording commenced on July 15, 2006, and wrapped up in late August 2006 . The album was produced by Jack Ponti, who had not produced an album since Doro's Machine II Machine (1995); he chose to work with Kittie because he felt that they  were not getting " [the due] they deserved in terms of their musicianship or their abilities", and because he wanted to do "things that are difficult  [rather] than things that are easy” [27]. The band recorded for six or eight hours per day, to avoid burnout [28] [29]. Ponti experimented with Kittie's sound on Funeral for Yesterday using different recording techniques, vintage instruments and microphone placements. Kittie said that the album was recorded with a "less is more" mentality; Morgan explained that this was "not 'less is more' in terms of the end product and the richness of the music,  [but] 'less is more' like you do less guitar tracks to make it sound fuller" [14] [30] [31]. [N 2] Mercedes' drums were recorded using a four-piece mic setup similar to John Bonham's on Led Zeppelin's "When the Leevee Breaks" . Whilst its guitars, bass and drums were recorded onto two-inch analogue tape, Ponti recorded the album's vocals using Pro Tools, which was also used to incorporate and arrange vocal harmonies—something which Kittie had not experimented with before—into the album . Ponti further affected its overall composition by scrapping most of McLeod's "planned" guitar parts in favour of her playing improvised licks;   likewise, 90% of Doan's basslines were changed as recording progressed [14] [29]. In comparison to Kittie's past producers, who let the band "do whatever the fuck  [they wanted]" when recording,  Morgan said that Ponti had more of "a definite idea of how he  [wanted] things to sound" and that working with him was "a bit rusty in the beginning"—it would take him and the band a week to record the album's first song [35]. Mercedes found that Kittie "didn't have a lot of say" in the way the album was recorded,  which she would later attribute to a "power struggle" between the band and Ponti that they ultimately lost "because he had the stronger personality" . In addition, Doan found working on the album "really awkward" after Ponti stopped speaking to her following an argument at the studio . [N 3]  Despite their conflicts, Morgan said that "In the end,  [everyone's] visions were the same—we wanted to make a great album."  Morgan also felt that Doan's situation was "more personal", as Ponti did not treat the other members of Kittie in this way . After recording was completed, Funeral for Yesterday was mixed at The Document Room in Malibu, California by Kevin Shirley between September 5 and September 14, 2006, before being sent to Sterling Sound to be mastered by Leon Zervos. On October 11, 2006, Mercedes announced that the album had been completed . The album's recording sessions were partially documented in a companion DVD released with physical editions of the album [44] [45]. 

# Composition and lyrics

Funeral for Yesterday sees Kittie mix their heavy musical side with a more melodic and vocal one,    [N 4] whilst showing signs of continued musical growth from the band with the introduction of guitar solos and vocal harmonies [48] [49] [50]. The album features more clean singing than on Kittie's previous releases,   although screamed and growled vocals are found on its heavier tracks such as "Witch Hunt" and "Last Goodbye" [8] [51] [47] [50]. The album's songs are played in the tuning of drop C [8] [52]. Critics and the band alike also noted the album for its softer, more accessible production and sound [32]. Morgan stated that Kittie wanted to "make an album where you could bang your head and sing along at the same time",  whilst Doan believed that the band had "worked more in a way that .. [47] [53] [51]. was to get songs on the radio."  Morgan and McLeod cited classic rock acts, including Van Halen, Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, as influences on the album's song structures and guitar solos . Lyrically, Morgan considered Funeral for Yesterday a loose concept album about "the demise of the former  [incarnation of Kittie],  [and] the resurrection of something new."    She also emphasized in a 2007 interview with Metal Edge that Kittie "wanted to make an impression and show people what we could do now .. [8]. [and] change people's opinions of us", and that the album represented "the death of the past and cleaning the slate."  The album's title track was described by IGN as "a tale of renewal for Morgan .. [56]. and for  [Kittie] as a whole". According to Morgan, "Everything That Could Have Been" covers "reflection of the past, and wishing to change it solely to see how differently the outcome would have been", whilst "Slow Motion" is about "seeing something or someone that you love die slowly, and  [that] there is nothing that can be done" [50]. In a 2007 interview with Revolver, Morgan said that "Never Again" is about Kittie "taking a stand never to be treated a certain way, never to be walked on again or allow ourselves to be vulnerable . We've dealt with these things before and made our mistakes, and now we're fucking warriors." [57]. 

# Release

## Promotion and touring

On August 28, 2006, Kittie announced that they would be releasing their next album through their own record label and management company, Kiss of Infamy Records. Ponti inspired the band to set up the label, and helped them secure distribution through EMI [28]. "We talked to a bunch of indie labels, but when it came down to it, starting our own business seemed like the right thing to do because we've always been a self-sufficient band", Mercedes said [57]. "We've never had help paying for tours, and we do all of our own merch, and we have our own clothing line  [Poisoned Black]. So it was the next logical step."  Kittie later changed their label's name to "X of Infamy" in December 2006 after the band received a cease-and-desist order from Gene Simmons, who owns the "Kiss" trademark [57]. " [The] X is clever, bewcause 'XOXO' means kiss anyway", Morgan said [57]. On October 25, 2006, Kittie unveiled Funeral for Yesterday's title and cover artwork. In the coming months, various tracks from the album would be uploaded to the band's MySpace page [29]. On November 14, 2006, a radio-ready version of the album's title track was posted online, with an "unofficial" music video for the song being released three days later [59]. An official music video, directed by Vincent Giordano, was filmed in Long Island, New York, on February 5, 2007,  before being made available to stream online on March 6, 2007 [62] [63]. Funeral for Yesterday was released in the United States by X of Infamy and Merovingian Music (MRV) on February 20, 2007. It was not released in Europe [66] [67]. From February to May 2007, Kittie embarked on a headlining tour of the United States, the Funeral for Yesterday Tour, supported by Walls of Jericho, 36 Crazyfists, Dead to Fall and In This Moment [68]. The band intended on touring the United Kingdom supporting Cradle of Filth in April 2007, but were forced to cancel after MRV refused to give them the necessary touring support [69] [70]. From July to September 2007, Kittie embarked on another headlining tour of the United States, the Sweet Revenge Tour, with It Dies Today, Silent Civilian, Bring Me the Horizon and Blessed by a Broken Heart . At one of the Sweet Revenge tour dates in Baltimore, Maryland on August 19, 2007, Kittie ended their set early after Morgan Lander was groped by a member of the audience, who was then attacked by the crowd [72] [73]. Outside of the band's tours, Kittie participated in radio interviews for Rockline (KLOS) and Mancow's Morning Madhouse (WRCX) and performed several acoustic shows at various FYE stores across the United States in April and May 2007 [74]. 

## Trish Doan's departure

During the production of Funeral for Yesterday, Trish Doan developed an eating disorder, anorexia athletica-nervosa. By the time Kittie began touring in support of the album, Doan had become "too skinny", and the other members of the band were concerned and frightened by her behaviour [78] [79] [80]. She was encouraged to leave the band if she need to look after her health, although Doan said she was "still in such denial and so caught up in myself that I just didn't care or I didn't really think about it" [81] [82]. Doan would ultimately leave Kittie after she fainted and fell off the stage at one of the band's shows [83]. On June 28, 2007, Kittie announced that Jeff Phillips (the band's former touring guitarist for Oracle)  would be filling in on bass for Doan for the Sweet Revenge Tour,  after which the band would hire Ivana "Ivy" Jenkins as their new bassist [72]. Kittie knew of Jenkins as she was supposed to have auditioned for the band in 2005, but was unable to because of "circumstances  [not] working in her  [favour] at the time", according to Morgan . On March 4, 2008, Kittie announced that Doan had left the band. Despite this, she would remain in contact with Morgan, Mercedes and McLeod and rejoin the band in February 2012, following Jenkins' departure [78]. However, Kittie did not work on any new material together afterwards, and Funeral for Yesterday subsequently became the final album Doan performed on before her death on February 11, 2017 [89]. In October 2017, Kittie performed an acoustic version of "Funeral for Yesterday" at the band's reunion concert celebrating the premiere of the Kittie: Origins/Evolutions documentary in Doan's memory [90] [91]. 

# Commercial performance

Funeral for Yesterday sold just under 9,000 copies during its first week of release, debuting at number 101 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album also reached number seven on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart [93]. By April 4, 2007, it had sold 20,000 copies in the United States [94]. The album's lead single, "Funeral For Yesterday", became Kittie's biggest radio hit, peaking at number 40 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart on April 14, 2007 [77]. To date, it is Kittie's only single to make an appearance on the chart [94] [95]. "Breathe" was also released as a single from the album, but failed to chart [94]. 

# Critical reception

Funeral for Yesterday received generally favourable reviews. AllMusic reviewer James Christopher Monger said that Kittie's new direction on the album "suits them in a way that indicates actual growth". Mark Fisher of the Times West Virginian also praised Kittie for expanding upon the melodic aspects of their sound whilst avoiding musical trends [47]. IGN's Ed Thompson called the album Kittie's "most comprehensive album" up to that point, praising the musical chemistry between the band's new members [49]. Aaron Burgess of the Phoenix New-Times felt that Kittie had succeeded in transitioning towards a pop-oriented sound, despite calling such a move "risky" [50]. Although its musical growth was praised, the album's vocal performances drew mixed reactions from critics. Reviewing the album for Now, Evan Davies panned Funeral for Yesterday for showcasing Morgan's "ultra-annoying ability to sing almost exclusively through her nose as she spouts trite, clichéd lyrics about pain and suffering."  Blabbermouth.net criticized Ponti's "robot choir" vocal production for making the album as a whole "forgettable" [1]. Conversely, Paul Gargano of LiveDaily saw its melodic vocals as indicative of Kittie's developing songwriting, and said that they made its songs "immensely more listenable" [52]. Monger and Fisher anticipated objections to Morgan's cleaner vocals from Kittie's fanbase, but felt that they did not take away from the album's heaviness and aggression [97]. Morgan and Mercedes have reflected unfavourably on Funeral for Yesterday in the years following its release, praising its songwriting but criticizing its production. In a 2009 interview with Carl Begai, Mercedes was particularly critical of the album's "over-produced" vocals: " [It] has six million harmonies on every chorus [98]. It made  [Morgan] sound like a fucking Chipmunk at the end of the day, which was ridiculous."  However, when asked by The Rockpit in 2010 if she regretted releasing the album, Mercedes stated: "I wouldn't say regret, we would have done it differently."  Morgan similarly commented that although she considered Funeral For Yesterday's songwriting some of Kittie's best work, its recording and production "didn't end up sounding the way I had hoped;"  she would call their next album, In the Black (2009), their attempt to "undo all the things  [the album] did" [98].
