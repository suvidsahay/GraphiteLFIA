# Plot

Alisha "Al" Khanna, a 30-year-old yoga instructor is working on an app but struggling to find investors while providing for her boyfriend Karan Arora, an unemployed writer. She also suffers from anxiety, dealing with her mother Sonali's suicide as a child, and is estranged from her father Vinod. Alisha's cousin Tia "Ti" is engaged to Zain Oberoi and invites the couple to their Alibaug beach house. Zain and Alisha bond due to their traumatic past and flirt with each other. Later, Alisha kisses him, regretting it after, but learns that Karan has allowed Tia to read his draft and feels hurt as she had been asking to read it since a longtime. She allows Zain back in and they begin an affair.. Zain gets his business to invest in Alisha's app. He reveals to her that his father was violent towards him and his mother, which encouraged his move to America. Later, Karan proposes Alisha in front of all his family and friends, including Tia and Zain, and Alisha accepts his proposal. She ends her affair with Zain to focus on her new beginnings with Karan. But she breaks up with Karan, after finding out that his book had been rejected, before he proposed, and he hid this from her. She and Zain continue their affair, and Zain tells her that he will end things with Tia, after returning her investment in his company. Zain's company again invests in Alisha's app and provides her with a new yoga studio.. At Zain and Tia's anniversary party, Alisha reveals to Zain that she is pregnant. Zain's company is placed under investigation when one of his investors is charged with money laundering. After Tia finds Alisha's anxiety pills in Zain's jacket, she confronts him. He appeases her by saying that he is stressed from work. Alisha's yoga studio is sealed by the investigating officers from Zain's company, and she confronts him, in front of his co-workers, during a business meeting. Zain's business partner, Jitesh, deduces the truth about Zain's affair with Alisha. Tia agrees to mortgage the beach house in Alibaug to save the company, but Zain sells it instead, convinced he can buy it back within a year. At Alibaug, Tia accuses him of having an affair and asks to see his phone. When he shows her his phone, she feels guilty and signs the papers. Karan tells Alisha that Tia is helping Zain with his company and both are in Alibaug. An angry Alisha gives Zain an ultimatum to reveal the truth to Tia, or she will.. Jitesh slyly suggests to Zain that he can use drugs to get rid of the evidence that Alisha is pregnant. Zain calls Alisha to his yacht and lies that he ended things with Tia. Alisha sees him mixing pills in her drink. Horrified, she tells Zain she wants to get back to land. Zain sees Tia's incoming call on Alisha's phone and asks her to decline; when she refuses, he attempts to push her overboard, but slips and hits his head on the railing of the yacht, drowning in the sea, as a result. A frightened Alisha rushes back home, where she has a miscarriage.. Tia calls the police and they find Zain's body. Jitesh, who knew about Zain's plan, threatens Alisha to get him the signed papers of the beach house sale or he will tell everyone the truth about their affair. Alisha does so and Jitesh covers up Zain's death as a suicide. Tia reveals to Alisha that her father Kumud had an affair with Sonali, and Alisha was actually born from their affair. Tia also informs her that Kumud had left the beach house in Alisha's name, in his will. Depressed, Alisha attempts to commit suicide, but is interrupted by Vinod. By not wanting to feel suffocated like her mother, Alisha realizes she has ended up exactly like her. She questions Vinod on why he never told her the truth about Sonali, and he comforts her by telling her that he did not want Sonali's life to be defined by that one mistake.. Two years later, Alisha now has a better relationship with Vinod, and attends Karan's engagement party, where she meets Tia. Tia wonders if revealing the truth to her was right, but Alisha reassures her that it was. Tia, who is still unaware of the affair between Zain and Alisha, agrees to mend their relationship. Karan introduces them to his fiancée's grandmother, who recognises Alisha instantly after recalling how she and Zain had helped her and her husband from a stranded boat. Alisha stares blankly at the woman, realizing that she cannot escape her past without confronting it..

Sanjana Jadhav of Pinkvilla gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 and wrote "Batra's Gehraiyaan is a deep dive into individual and family's past choices, relationships and why we do, what we do [27]. The director has successfully struck a balance of intimacy, shock, grief and above all love". Renuka Vyavahare of The Times Of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote "Batra tries to decode complex human behaviour and its consequences, through a story that's tough to narrate" [28].

Shilajit Mitra of The New Indian Express rated the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote "As a narrative, Gehraiyaan goes commendably far for a mainstream Hindi film [34]. But its words tend to trip up the ride". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3/5 stars and wrote "Gehraiyaan is a mature relationship drama with niche appeal, bravura performances and an exciting climax" [35]. Phuong Le of The Guardian rated the film 3 out of 5 and said "While the lurid twists and turns are enjoyable in a '90s erotic thriller kind of way, the sudden shift towards suspense doesn't hamper Padukone's performance [36]. And what a performance it is!" [37]. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2 out of 5 and wrote "The foursome of Padukone-Chaturvedi-Panday-Karwa should have been a throbbing hot mess, but the film doesn't go deep enough". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2 out of 5 and wrote "The film is about youthful, adventurous love, but it is utterly devoid of humour and zing [38]. When it tries to lighten up, it falls flat". Shantanu Ray Chaudhari of The Free Press Journal gave the film 1 out of 5 and wrote "The writing veers between the trite and the ridiculous." [39] [40].
