  "summary": "Funeral for Yesterday is the fourth studio album by Canadian heavy metal band Kittie, released on February 20, 2007. It was the only album released through the band's own record label, X of Infamy Records, and Merovingian Music (MRV). The album was produced by Jack Ponti, and was recorded at RetroMedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, New Jersey, between July and August 2006. Envisioned as a loose concept album about the band's demise and rebirth following a period of turmoil, the album saw Kittie transition towards a more melodic and accessible sound while retaining some of their heavier sensibilities, and was also noted for its greater use of clean singing than on the band's previous releases. It was the first Kittie album with guitarist Tara McLeod, and only with bassist Trish Doan.  \nFuneral for Yesterday debuted at number 101 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling just under 9,000 copies in its first week. Its lead single and title track, \"Funeral For Yesterday\", became Kittie's biggest radio hit, reaching number 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Reviews were generally favourable, with critics praising Kittie's musical growth on the album; however, its vocals drew mixed reactions. Kittie were disappointed with the album's production and their lack of control over its outcome, and sought to distance themselves from its sound with their subsequent releases. It was the final album Doan performed on before her death in 2017.",
