  "summary": "The Northman is a 2022 American epic historical action thriller film directed by Robert Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sj\u00f3n. Based on the legend of Amleth, the film stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd (who also produced), Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Bj\u00f6rk and Willem Dafoe. The plot centers on Amleth, a Viking prince who sets out on a quest to avenge the murder of his father. The film is heavily influenced by Norse mythology.Skarsg\u00e5rd had wanted to make a Viking film for several years, and Eggers decided to make the film his third project after the pair met to discuss possible collaborations. Much of the cast joined in October 2019, and filming took place in locations throughout Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Iceland from August to December 2020.\nThe Northman had its world premiere in Stockholm at Rigoletto Cinema on March 28, 2022. It began theatrical release in some countries on April 13, 2022, and was released theatrically in the United States on April 22 to critical acclaim, with praise for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, visual effects, musical score and the performances. Although the film had underperformed at the worldwide box office, it later found financial success at the VOD and other post-theatrical markets.",
