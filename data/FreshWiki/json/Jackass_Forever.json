  "summary": "Jackass Forever (stylized as jackass fore\u2665er) is a 2022 American stunt comedy film directed and produced by Jeff Tremaine, along with producers Spike Jonze and Johnny Knoxville, and was released by Paramount Pictures. It is the fourth main installment in the Jackass film series, following Jackass 3D (2010). The film stars original Jackass members Knoxville, Steve-O, Dave England, Wee Man, Danger Ehren, Chris Pontius, Preston Lacy, as well as newcomers Sean \"Poopies\" McInerney, Zach Holmes, Jasper Dolphin, Eric Manaka, Rachel Wolfson, the Jackass film crew, and celebrity guests. This is the first Jackass film not to feature Ryan Dunn since his death in 2011 and the first without Bam Margera being a primary cast member as he was fired during production, appearing in only one skit.\nJackass Forever premiered at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, on February 1, 2022, and was theatrically released on February 4. The film was well-received by critics, with many considering it the best film of the franchise. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $80 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million.\nUnused footage from the film was compiled separately, titled Jackass 4.5, and released on Netflix on May 20, 2022.",
