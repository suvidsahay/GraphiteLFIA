  "summary": "On the morning of April 12, 2022, a mass shooting was committed on a northbound N train on the New York City Subway in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York, United States. At approximately 8:24 a.m. EDT, a 62-year-old Black nationalist Frank Robert James put on a gas mask, threw two smoke grenades, and fired a handgun 33 times. The shooting occurred as the train was traveling between the 59th Street and 36th Street stations.\nAlthough no one died, 29 people were injured; ten victims were hit by direct gunfire, while the remaining injuries were from smoke inhalation. Most passengers disembarked at 36th Street, where some passengers fled onto an R train that traveled one additional stop to 25th Street. On the day after the attack, Frank James was arrested as the suspect after a large manhunt. James was charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York with committing a terrorist act on a mass transit system and discharging a firearm during the commission of a Crime of Violence, to which James pleaded not guilty. On January 3, 2023, James pled guilty to federal terrorism charges. On October 5, 2023, James was sentenced to life in prison.",
