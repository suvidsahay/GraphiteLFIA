  "summary": "The 2022 Welsh Open (officially the 2022 BetVictor Welsh Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 28 February to 6 March 2022 at the International Convention Centre Wales at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales. It was the 12th ranking event of the 2021\u201322 snooker season, and the 31st edition of the Welsh Open, first held in 1992. It was the seventh of eight tournaments in the season's European Series, and the fourth and final event of the Home Nations Series. The tournament was broadcast by BBC Cymru Wales, BBC Online, BBC Red Button, Quest and Eurosport domestically.\nJordan Brown was the defending champion, having defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 9\u20138 in the final of the 2021 event. However, Brown lost 3\u20134 in his held-over qualifying match against Mitchell Mann. Joe Perry defeated Judd Trump 9\u20135 in the final to capture his first Welsh Open title and the second ranking title of his career. Aged 47 years and 205 days, Perry became the oldest player to win a ranking tournament since Ray Reardon, who was 50 years and 14 days old when he won the 1982 Professional Players Tournament. However, Mark Williams surpassed Perry the following season by winning the 2023 British Open aged 48 years and 194 days. There were 52 century breaks made during the main venue stage of the event; the highest was a 142, made by Michael White in the second round.",
