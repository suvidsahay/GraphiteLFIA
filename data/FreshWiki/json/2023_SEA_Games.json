The announcement was made at the Southeast Asian Games Federation Council meeting in Singapore, in conjunction with the 2015 SEA Games, by the President of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia, Thong Khon. The Philippines was originally scheduled to host the games, but was pushed forward to 2019 after Brunei withdrew to host the event. This was the first time that Cambodia hosted the games, as the 1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games was cancelled due to the political situation in the country at the time. The event was planned to feature 40 sports. The final number was 37 sports.",
