  "summary": "Zillennials (also known as Zennials) is the demographic cohort on the cusp of the millennial and Generation Z cohorts. Their adjacency between the two generations and limited age grade has led to their characterization as a \"micro-generation.\" They are generally the children of the members of Generation Jones and Generation X. Estimates of the U.S. population in this cohort range from 30 million to 48 million.In infancy or early childhood during the September 11th terrorist attacks they were the first cohort to experience adolescence in a post-9/11 world. The majority of this cohort came of age during the 2010s, with the U.K. Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election of 2016 and COVID-19 pandemic being key formative events. Zillennials experienced the Digital Revolution of the 2000s and 2010s, navigating mobile LTE internet, cell phones, mobile devices and smartphones.Zillennials code-switch between generations, have high levels of digital literacy, and are more likely to self-identify into a minority group. Zillennials are less wealthy but more economically secure than Generation Z, commanding relatively high spending power in the U.S. economy, especially when compared to millennials. They have high brand loyalty, low price sensitivity, and stable purchasing patterns.",
