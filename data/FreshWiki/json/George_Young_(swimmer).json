  "summary": "George Young (3 March 1909 \u2013 6 August 1972) was a Canadian marathon swimmer who, on 15\u201316 January 1927, became the first person to swim the 22 mile channel between Catalina Island and the mainland of California.  Though familiar to the Toronto swimming community, Young was only seventeen and a relative unknown in America, lacking the national recognition of a number of his competitors.  Around three thousand spectators on Catalina Island watched the race begin.  Young's 22 mile swim began with the sound of a starter's pistol on the Northeastern edge of Catalina Island at the narrow point of the Harbor at Isthmus Cove at 11:21 AM on Saturday, January 15, 1927, and ended the next morning after 15 hours 44 minutes at 3:06 AM on the rocky shores of Point Vicente Lighthouse, in Rancho Palos Verdes, South of downtown Los Angeles.",
