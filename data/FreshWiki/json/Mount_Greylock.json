  "summary": "Mount Greylock in northwest Massachusetts is the highest point in the state at 3,489 feet (1,063 meters). The peak played a role in early American literature, and is part of the Taconic Mountains, which are geologically distinct from the nearby Berkshires and Green Mountains. Expansive views and a small area of sub-alpine forest characterize its upper reaches. A seasonal automobile road crosses the summit area, passing near its three structures from the 1930s which together constitute a small, \"National Historic District.\" Various hiking paths including the Appalachian Trail  traverse the area, which is part of the larger Mount Greylock State Reservation.",
