  "summary": "Parliamentary elections were held in Hungary on 3 April 2022 to elect the National Assembly, coinciding with a referendum.Hungary's incumbent prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n declared victory on Sunday night, with partial results showing his Fidesz party leading the vote by a wide margin. Addressing his supporters after the partial results, Orb\u00e1n said: \"We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels\". Opposition leader P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay admitted defeat shortly after Orb\u00e1n's speech. Reuters described it as a \"crushing victory\".The election had been predicted to be closer than in previous years, but Fidesz still held a 5\u20136 percentage point lead in the polls leading up to the vote. OSCE deployed a full monitoring mission for the vote. With Orb\u00e1n seeking a fourth consecutive term in office, preliminary results showed his party Fidesz outperforming polls, winning its first absolute majority of the vote share since 2010 while expanding its supermajority to control 135 seats of the 199-seat Parliament, comfortably ahead of the opposition alliance United for Hungary, which was set to win 57 seats after 100% of the votes had been counted. The Mi Haz\u00e1nk party won seats for the first time, obtaining 6 seats.With 54.13% of the popular vote, Fidesz received the highest vote share by any party since the fall of communism in 1989.",
