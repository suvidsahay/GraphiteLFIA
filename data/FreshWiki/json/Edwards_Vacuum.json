  "summary": "Edwards Ltd is a British multinational vacuum pump and exhaust gas management systems manufacturer. Its headquarters are in Burgess Hill, UK, and has been part of the Atlas Copco Group since 2014. Edwards holds 1,700 patents, including for dry (oil-free) vacuum pumps, and produces equipment used for manufacturing semiconductors,  scientific research, freeze drying and other industries. Its pumps remove contaminants at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Manufacturing is predominantly handled by subsidiary businesses in the Czech Republic, South Korea, USA and China. Edwards' global research and development facilities remain in the UK.Major customers in 2012 included Samsung, Hynix, Agilent and LG.",
