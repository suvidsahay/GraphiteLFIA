  "summary": "From 14 June to October 2022, floods in Pakistan killed 1,739 people, and caused \u20a8 3.2 trillion ($14.9 billion) of damage and \u20a8 3.3 trillion ($15.2 billion) of economic losses. The immediate causes of the floods were heavier than usual monsoon rains and melting glaciers that followed a severe heat wave, both of which are linked to climate change.\nOn 25 August, Pakistan declared a state of emergency because of the flooding.The flooding was the world's deadliest flood since the 2020 South Asian floods and described as the worst in the country's history. It was also recorded as one of the costliest natural disasters in world history.",
