  "summary": "Pinoy Big Brother: Kumunity Season 10, also known as Pinoy Big Brother Season 10, is the tenth main and sixteenth overall season of the Philippine reality television series, Pinoy Big Brother. The season, which premiered on October 16, 2021, was the second to partner with the social-media app Kumu; \"Kumunity\" is a portmanteau of \"Kumu\" and \"community\".\nThe season revolves around three groups (known as \"batches\") of housemates, representing three Kumunities: celebrities, adults and teens. The top two in each batch were eligible to be the season's \"Big Winner\", along with four wildcard housemates chosen in a series of challenges.Bianca Gonzalez-Intal and Robi Domingo again hosted the season, and Kim Chiu, Melai Cantiveros and Enchong Dee were co-hosts. Toni Gonzaga also reprised her role as the show's main host but later stepped down from the role. Gonzalez assumed Gonzaga's duties as the show's main host. The season ended on May 29, 2022. After 226 days, celebrity housemate Anji Salvacion was the season's \"Ultimate Big Winner\". Salvacion won the \u20b12 million grand prize, and adult housemate Isabel Laohoo was the runner-up. Samantha Bernardo, Robert Blackburn, and Brenda Mage placed third to fifth, respectively. She was the second celebrity winner in a combined season, and the fourth celebrity winner overall, since Daniel Matsunaga of All In in 2014.",
