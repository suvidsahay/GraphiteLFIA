  "summary": "LK-99 (from the Lee-Kim 1999 research) is a gray\u2013black, polycrystalline compound, identified as a copper-doped lead\u2012oxyapatite. A team from Korea University led by Lee Sukbae (\uc774\uc11d\ubc30) and Kim Ji-Hoon (\uae40\uc9c0\ud6c8) began studying this material as a potential superconductor starting in 1999.:\u200a1\u200a In July 2023, they published preprints claiming that it acts as a room-temperature superconductor:\u200a8\u200a at temperatures of up to 400 K (127 \u00b0C; 260 \u00b0F) at ambient pressure.:\u200a1\u200aMany different researchers have attempted to replicate the work, and were able to reach initial results within weeks, as the process of producing the material is relatively straightforward. By mid-August 2023, the consensus was that LK-99 is not a superconductor at any temperature, and is an insulator in pure form.As of October 1, no replications have gone through the peer review process of a journal, but some have been reviewed by a materials science lab. A number of replication attempts identified non-superconducting ferromagnetic and diamagnetic causes for observations that suggested superconductivity. A prominent cause was a copper sulfide impurity occurring during the proposed synthesis, which can produce resistance drops, lambda transition in heat capacity, and magnetic response in small samples.After the initial preprints were published, Lee claimed they were incomplete, and coauthor Kim Hyun-Tak (\uae40\ud604\ud0c1) said one of the papers contained flaws.",
