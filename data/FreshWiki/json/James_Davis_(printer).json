  "summary": "James Davis (October 21, 1721 \u2013 1785) was an early American printer and the first printer and first postmaster of the colony of North Carolina. He was also the founder and printer of the North-Carolina Gazette, North Carolina colony's first newspaper. After working with William Parks in Virginia he removed to New Bern to pursue a printing career upon learning that an official printer was needed in that colony. Soon after his arrival he began to put down roots, married, and became active in local politics, holding several positions in public office, including  membership in the North Carolina Assembly and thereafter a county Sheriff.\nDavis secured the position of the official printer for the colonial government of the North Carolina colony and was first to print its laws and paper currency. As an accomplished and official printer, Davis was later suspected by some of counterfeiting monetary notes, but the allegations were made by a career criminal, himself convicted of multiple counts of counterfeiting and thievery, while facing execution, and the allegations were never substantiated. Thereafter he went on serving as the colony's official printer and as a North Carolina justice of the peace. Davis supported the cause for American independence and to this end was politically active as a printer and politician before and during the American Revolution.",
