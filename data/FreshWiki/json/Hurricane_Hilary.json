  "summary": "Hurricane Hilary was a large, potent Category 4 Pacific hurricane in August 2023 which brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.\nThe eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Hilary originated from a disturbance south of Mexico associated with a tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean from Central America on August 12. The disturbance gradually grew more organized, and was named Tropical Storm Hilary while off the coast of Manzanillo, Colima, on August 16. Hilary quickly strengthened into a hurricane the next day. While tracking west-northwestward on August 17 and 18, it underwent rapid intensification, reaching its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) and a central pressure of 939 mbar (27.7 inHg). The cyclone then quickly weakened the following day due to the effects of cooler sea surface temperatures, drier air, and increasing wind shear. After weakening into a tropical storm, Hilary made landfall in San Quint\u00edn, Baja California, at 18:00 UTC on August 20, about 215 mi (345 km) south-southeast of San Diego, California. It then tracked northward into California, retaining its tropical characteristics through the morning of August 21. It then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone while over the southern San Joaquin Valley. Hilary was the first tropical storm to enter California since Nora in 1997.In anticipation of \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico\u2013United States border to just north of Los Angeles. Persistent heavy rainfall, potentially \"more than a year\u2019s worth of rain\" in some areas, was forecasted. Due to this, flood watches were issued, affecting about 26 million people across four states (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah), and the entire region was placed under a high risk threat for flash flooding by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).Two fatalities, both in Mexico, have been linked to Hilary. Additionally, the storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Even so, its overall impact on the region was less severe than initially feared.",
