It was the United States' first victory in ten years, and the ninth victory of the country in the pageant's history. R'Bonney Gabriel was the oldest entrant to be crowned, surpassing Andrea Meza of Mexico in 2020.\nContestants from eighty-three countries and territories competed in this year's pageant. The competition was hosted by Jeannie Mai and Miss Universe 2012 Olivia Culpo; Culpo last served as host during Miss Universe 2020, while Mai last served as backstage correspondent during Miss Universe 2014. Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray and Zuri Hall served as backstage correspondents.This was the first edition of the pageant to be held under the ownership of Thailand-based JKN Global Group, which purchased the Miss Universe Organization from WME/IMG on 26 October 2022. The competition was the first event since 1954 not to be televised in any major American television network, but it would air on the streaming provider The Roku Channel as the official broadcaster of the show for the first time. It was also the first Miss Universe event to be aired by JKN Global Group's television networks, JKN18 and JKN-CNBC as the pageant's official broadcaster for Thailand where the expanded headquarters of Miss Universe Organization are located.",
