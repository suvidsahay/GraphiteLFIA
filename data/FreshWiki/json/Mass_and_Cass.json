  "summary": "Mass and Cass, also known as Methadone Mile or Recovery Road, is a tent city in Boston, Massachusetts located at and around the intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue. It is located in the area of Newmarket, an industrial part of Boston that includes some of Dorchester, South Boston, Roxbury, Boston, and the South End.Due to its concentration of neighborhood services providing help, the area around Mass and Cass has long attracted a large number of people struggling with homelessness and drug addiction, especially after the closure of facilities on Long Island, in the Boston Harbor Islands. It has been characterized as \"the epicenter of the region's opioid addiction crisis\".",
