  "summary": "On 2 June 2023, three trains collided in Balasore district in Odisha state of eastern India. The Coromandel Express entered the passing loop instead of the main line near Bahanaga Bazar railway station at full speed and collided with a goods train. Due to the high speed of the Coromandel Express, its 21 coaches derailed and three of those collided with the oncoming SMVT Bengaluru\u2013Howrah Superfast Express on the adjacent track.\nA total of 296 people were killed in the crash and more than 1,200 others were injured. It was India's deadliest railway crash since the Firozabad rail collision in 1995, although the Gaisal train collision in 1999 may have killed more people. It was also the deadliest rail disaster worldwide since the 2004 Sri Lanka tsunami train wreck.",
