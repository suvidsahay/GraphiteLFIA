  "summary": "The 2023 Tour de France was the 110th edition of the Tour de France. It started in Bilbao, Spain, on 1 July and ended with the final stage at Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris, on 23 July. \nDefending champion Jonas Vingegaard (Team Jumbo\u2013Visma) won the general classification for the second year in a row. Two-time champion Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates) finished in second place, with Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates) finishing third.\nThe race began in Bilbao in the Basque Country before returning to France. The first two weeks of the race was closely fought between Vingegaard and Poga\u010dar, with just 10 seconds between the riders by the end of the second week. The decisive stages were the individual time trial on stage 16 where Vingegaard won by 1 minute 38 seconds ahead of Poga\u010dar, and the subsequent stage in the Alps where Vingegaard extended his lead to over seven minutes. Vingegaard won the Tour for the second year running, putting him equal on Tour wins with his rival Poga\u010dar. His winning margin of 7 minutes 29 seconds was the largest since 2014. \nThe points classification was won by Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck) for the first time. The mountains classification was won by Giulio Ciccone (Trek\u2013Segafredo), the first Italian to achieve this feat since 1992. The young rider classification was won by Poga\u010dar for the fourth year in a row, and the team of Team Jumbo\u2013Visma won the team classification. Victor Campenaerts (Lotto\u2013Dstny) was chosen as the most combative rider.\nThe race was followed by the second edition of the Tour de France Femmes, which held its first stage on the final day of the men's Tour.",
