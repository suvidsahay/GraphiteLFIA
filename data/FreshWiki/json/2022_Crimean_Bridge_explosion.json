  "summary": "On 8 October 2022, at 6:07 a.m., a fire broke out on the Crimean Bridge as a result of an explosion of a bomb loaded onto a truck, which occurred on the road bridge, on the westbound vehicle lanes running from Russia to Kerch in Russian-occupied Crimea. Two two-lane vehicular spans of the bridge collapsed into the water. Two adjacent eastbound lanes on a separate structure survived. The railway bridge was also significantly damaged by a railway tanker car that caught fire. Five people were killed, and the Investigative Committee of Russia launched an investigation.\nThe damage reduced the transport capacity of the bridge, which is being used to supply Russian troops in Crimea during the invasion of Ukraine. The explosion occurred the day after the 70th birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one week after the announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia. At the time, no-one claimed responsibility for the explosion and Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian government \"did not order\" it. However, in July 2023, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar acknowledged Ukraine had conducted the attack \"in order to break the logistics of the Russians.\" Soon after, the Ukrainian Security Service confirmed it was behind the attack.Russian officials and a \"senior Ukrainian official\" speaking to The New York Times said the explosion was from a bomb loaded onto a truck. The BBC claimed it was more likely caused by a maritime drone. The Russian Federal Security Service detained five Russian citizens and three people from Ukraine and Armenia accused of organising the attack. In August 2023, Vasyl Malyuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, gave an interview to The New Voice of Ukraine in which he detailed how a truck carrying explosives was used to cause the explosion.",
