  "summary": "Typhoon Hinnamnor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Henry, was a very large and powerful tropical cyclone that impacted  Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Russia. The eleventh named storm, fourth typhoon, and the 1st super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor originated from a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27 by the JTWC. This area soon formed into Tropical Storm Hinnamnor on the next day. The storm rapidly intensified, and became a typhoon on the August 29. Overnight, Hinnamnor cleared a small eye along with a well-defined CDO, and intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, the first tropical cyclone to do so in 2022.\nHinnanmor then weakened due to undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. However, it re-intensified to a Category 5 super typhoon with a larger eye and CDO south of Okinawa. An increasingly hostile environment caused it to lose its convective features the night of September 1, weakening it down to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. As the storm accelerated northward into the East China Sea, it rebuilt itself throughout the next day, and began intensifying again. The storm gained major status once again on September 4, and headed northeastwards towards Busan. Beginning to weaken for the final time on September 5, the storm made landfall late that day as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and began extratropical transition.\nAs Hinnamnor approached, many advisories concerning the storm were issued in Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea. The typhoon brought flooding rainfall and powerful winds to Okinawa, and thousands of homes suffered power outages. Heavy rainfall affected northern districts in Taiwan, and a man died in the Philippines due to Hinnamnor's flooding. Hinnamnor made landfall just southeast of Geoje in South Korea, knocking out power for tens of thousands of homes. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for 20 deaths, 1 missing and US$1.81 billion in damage across several countries.",
