  "summary": "Minions: The Rise of Gru (also known as Minions 2) is a 2022 American animated comedy film produced by Illumination and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the sequel to Minions (2015), a prequel to Despicable Me (2010), and the fifth entry overall in the Despicable Me franchise. The film was directed by Kyle Balda, co-directed by Brad Ableson and Jonathan del Val (in Ableson's feature directorial debut), and produced by Chris Meledandri, Janet Healy and Chris Renaud, from a screenplay written by Matthew Fogel, and a story by Fogel and Brian Lynch. It features Steve Carell reprising his role as Gru and Pierre Coffin as the Minions. New cast members include Taraji P. Henson, Michelle Yeoh, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews and Alan Arkin. In the film, an eleven-year-old Gru plans to become a supervillain with the help of his Minions, which leads to a showdown with a malevolent team, the Vicious 6.\nAfter being delayed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Minions: The Rise of Gru had its world premiere at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 13, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 1. The film received generally positive reviews from critics; some deemed it an improvement over its predecessor, with praise earned for its score, animation, humor, voice performances (particularly Carell's), and aesthetic, although its plot was criticized. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $939 million worldwide and making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2022.",
