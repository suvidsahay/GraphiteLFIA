  "summary": "The Argentina national football team (Spanish: Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Argentina) represents Argentina in men's international football and is administered by the Argentine Football Association, the governing body for football in Argentina.\nNicknamed La Albiceleste ('The White and Sky Blue'), they are the reigning world champions, having won the most recent World Cup in 2022, earning their third star shown by the team's crest. Overall, Argentina has appeared in a World Cup final six times, a record equaled by Italy and surpassed only by Brazil and Germany. Argentina played in the first ever final in 1930, which they lost 4\u20132 to Uruguay. The following final appearance came 48 years later, in 1978, when the team captained by Daniel Passarella defeated the Netherlands 3\u20131 in extra time, becoming world champions for the first time. Captained by Diego Maradona, Argentina won their second World Cup eight years later, in 1986, with a 3\u20132 final victory over West Germany. They reached the final once more under the guidance of Maradona, in 1990, but were ultimately beaten 1\u20130 by West Germany. A few decades later, Argentina, led by Lionel Messi made their fifth final appearance in 2014, losing to Germany 1\u20130 after extra time. In 2022, again captained by Messi, they were crowned world champions for the third time, the fourth-most of any country, beating France 4\u20132 on penalties, following a 3\u20133 draw after extra time.\nThe team's World Cup\u2013winning managers are C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni in 2022. Since the Golden Ball for the tournament's best player was officially awarded by FIFA in 1982, Argentina players have won it thrice: Maradona in 1986 and Messi in 2014 and 2022. Argentines Guillermo St\u00e1bile in 1930 and Mario Kempes in 1978 were the top-scoring players at their respective World Cups.\nArgentina has also been very successful in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning it 15 times, a record shared with Uruguay, most recently winning the 2021 edition. The team won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992. Argentina is the most successful team in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, having won it twice, in 1993 and 2022. Argentina is known for having rivalries with Brazil, Uruguay, England, Germany and the Netherlands. As of 2023, Argentina holds the record for most official titles won by a men's national team with 22. Individually for Argentina, Lionel Messi is the all-time most-capped player with 180 games and the highest goalscorer with 106 goals. As of October 2023 Argentina ranks 1st by FIFA.",
