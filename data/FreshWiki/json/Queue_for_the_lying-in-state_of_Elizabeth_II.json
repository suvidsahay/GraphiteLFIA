  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II",
  "summary": "A queue of mourners waited to file past the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II while she lay in state at Westminster Hall in London, England, from 14 to 19 September 2022 after Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022.  It was widely known in contemporary media coverage as \"The Queue\".\nTwo separate queues for mourners operated.  The main queue had a length of up to 10 miles (16 kilometres) and a maximum waiting time of more than 24 hours; this was the queue that attracted the most media attention.  There was also an accessible queue for people with disabilities or long-term health conditions.\nThe queues opened at 17:00 BST on 14 September.  The accessible queue was closed to new entrants at 16:33 on 17 September, and the main queue closed at 22:41 on 18 September.  The lying in state ended shortly after 06:30 on 19 September, in advance of Elizabeth II's state funeral later that day.  About 250,000 people were estimated to have waited in the queue.\nThe media and academics commented on the significance of the queue as a symbol of the relationship of British people to their monarch, as a social phenomenon, and as reinforcement of the stereotype that British people enjoy queueing and are disciplined at doing so.",
