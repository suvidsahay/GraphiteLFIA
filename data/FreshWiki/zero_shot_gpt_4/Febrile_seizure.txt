# Febrile Seizure

## Introduction

### Definition

A febrile seizure refers to a convulsion in children triggered by a spike in body temperature, often due to an infection. These seizures occur in infants and young children and are an alarming and distressing event for parents and caregivers. Despite this, the majority of febrile seizures are harmless and don't indicate a long-term or ongoing health concern.

### Epidemiology

Febrile seizures are common in young children, with 2 to 5% of children experiencing at least one episode before their fifth birthday. They are particularly common in toddlers, and boys are slightly more likely to have a febrile seizure than girls. Certain populations, such as those of Japanese and Korean descent, have a higher incidence of febrile seizures.

## Causes

### Infections

Febrile seizures are frequently linked to viral or bacterial infections. The most common infections associated with febrile seizures include the influenza virus, ear infections (otitis media), roseola, and upper respiratory tract infections. 

### Genetic Predisposition

Febrile seizures seem to run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Children with a parent or sibling who had febrile seizures are more likely to have one. Several specific genes have been implicated in the predisposition to febrile seizures, but more research is needed to fully understand their roles.

### Immunizations

Immunizations can occasionally trigger febrile seizures. This is due to the fever that can follow vaccinations, rather than the vaccine itself. 

## Classification

### Simple Febrile Seizures

These are the most common type of febrile seizures. Simple febrile seizures last for fewer than 15 minutes and do not reoccur within a 24-hour period. They also involve the whole body rather than just a portion of it.

### Complex Febrile Seizures

Complex febrile seizures last longer, occur more than once within 24 hours, or are confined to one side of the child's body.

## Symptoms

### Before Seizure

Before a seizure, children may show signs of illness such as a fever higher than 100.4°F (38°C), irritability, or tiredness.

### During Seizure

During a febrile seizure, a child may lose consciousness, shake or jerk arms and legs, or urinate or defecate. Their eyes may roll back, and they may become stiff or limp.

### After Seizure

After a seizure, a child may be sleepy or confused. They may also be irritable or nauseous.

## Diagnosis

### Medical History

Doctors will ask about the child's health history, including details about any recent illnesses and the specifics of the seizure, such as when it occurred and how long it lasted.

### Physical Examination

A thorough physical exam will be conducted to determine the cause of the fever.

### Laboratory Tests

In some cases, a doctor may order blood tests, urine tests, or a lumbar puncture to help determine the cause of the fever and seizure.

### Imaging Studies

Rarely, imaging studies such as an MRI or CT scan may be used to rule out other causes of the seizure.

## Treatment

### Immediate Care

The most crucial immediate care for a child having a febrile seizure is to ensure their safety during the seizure. This means placing them on their side, not restraining them, and ensuring that they can't hurt themselves.

### Medication

In most cases, children with febrile seizures don't need daily medication. Antipyretic medication may be given to control the fever.

### Surgery

Surgery is not a common treatment for febrile seizures as they are typically not associated with any structural brain abnormalities.

## Complications

### Status Epilepticus

One severe complication is status epilepticus, a condition where seizures last longer than 30 minutes, or occur close together without the person regaining consciousness.

### Recurrence

About one-third of children who have a febrile seizure will have another one with a future fever.

## Prognosis

### Risk of Epilepsy

Although febrile seizures can be frightening, the vast majority of children who have them do not develop epilepsy or other seizure disorders.

## Prevention

### Fever Management

Parents should monitor their child's temperature during illnesses and use antipyretic medication as directed by a healthcare provider.

### Vaccination

Getting all the recommended childhood vaccinations on schedule can prevent many of the infections that can cause febrile seizures.

## Current Research

### Genetic Studies

Current research is focusing on understanding the genetic factors that predispose children to febrile seizures. 

### Novel Treatments

Researchers are also investigating new treatments for preventing febrile seizures and reducing their impact.
