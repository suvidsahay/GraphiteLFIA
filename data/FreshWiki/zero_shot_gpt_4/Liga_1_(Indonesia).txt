# Liga 1 (Indonesia)

## Overview
Liga 1, formerly known as the Indonesian Super League, is the top-tier professional football league in Indonesia. It is operated by PT Liga Indonesia Baru, which is under the auspices of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). This article will delve into the history, structure, and competition format of Liga 1, its current and past teams, notable records, sponsorship and media coverage, controversies and criticisms, and its impact and legacy.

### History
The history of Liga 1 dates back to 2008 when it was established as the Indonesian Super League (ISL) to replace the Liga Indonesia Premier Division. However, due to a disagreement between the PSSI and the Sports and Youth Ministry, the league was temporarily suspended in 2015. It was later rebranded and relaunched as Liga 1 in 2017, marking a new era for professional football in Indonesia.

### Structure and Competition Format
The structure of Liga 1 mirrors that of many European leagues, featuring a system of promotion and relegation with Liga 2, the second tier of Indonesian football. Each season, which typically runs from March to December, involves 18 teams that play each other twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 34 matches. The team with the highest number of points at the end of the season is crowned champion.

### Promotion and Relegation
At the end of each season, the bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2 and replaced by the top three teams from Liga 2. This system is designed to ensure competitiveness and maintain the quality of the league.

## Current Teams (Current Season)
