# SpaceX Starship Integrated Flight Test

## Overview
### Concept and Design
The SpaceX Starship is an integral part of Elon Musk's ambitious plan to make human life multiplanetary. A fully reusable spacecraft, the Starship is designed for long-duration crewed missions to destinations such as Mars. Its design features a stainless steel structure, which offers both strength and durability, while its Raptor engines use liquid oxygen and methane, which can be synthesized on Mars, thereby facilitating return trips.

### Purpose
The overarching purpose of the Starship project is to facilitate large-scale human colonization of Mars. However, the vehicle also holds potential for missions to other celestial bodies, including the Moon. Additionally, it could serve as a high-speed transportation method between destinations on Earth.

### Timeline
The Starship project began in earnest in 2012, with initial tests conducted using the Grasshopper prototype. Over the years, the project has seen various development stages, with notable milestones achieved through the testing of Starhopper in 2019, and the SN5 and SN6 prototypes in 2020.

## History
### Development and Testing Phases
#### Grasshopper and F9R Dev (2012â€“2015)
The development of Starship began with the Grasshopper and F9R Dev prototypes, which laid the groundwork for reusable rockets. These prototypes were used to perform short vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) tests, with the Grasshopper reaching a height of 744m, thereby proving the feasibility of rocket reusability.

#### Starhopper (2019)
The Starhopper served as the initial prototype for the Starship design. It successfully performed a series of tests, including untethered hops reaching an altitude of 150m. This marked a significant step forward, as these tests verified the Starship's Raptor engine, and the vehicle's ability to control its descent and land vertically.

#### SN5 and SN6 (2020)
In 2020, the SN5 and SN6 prototypes successfully performed 150m hops. These tests validated the vehicle's single-engine ascent and landing capabilities, as well as its fueling and pressurization systems, marking a significant advancement towards the integrated flight test.

### Funding
The development of Starship is primarily funded by SpaceX, with additional funding sourced from external contracts. Notably, SpaceX was awarded a $135 million contract by NASA in 2020, to further develop the Starship for the Artemis program.

## Description of the Test Flights
### Launch and Ascent
The launch of a Starship integrated flight test begins with the vehicle's powerful Raptor engines igniting, propelling the vehicle skyward. The ascent phase aims to test the Starship's ability to handle the extreme stresses of launch, while delivering payloads to the required altitude.

### Mid-flight
In the mid-flight phase, the Starship transitions from vertical to horizontal orientation, as it would in an actual mission to Mars. This 'belly flop' maneuver tests the Starship's aerodynamic capabilities and control surfaces.

### Landing and Recovery
The Starship's landing is a critical aspect of the test flights. After reorienting to vertical, the vehicle must slow its descent and land vertically, showcasing its full reusability. The landing phase tests the vehicle's heat shielding, structural integrity, and control during descent.

## Flight List
As of now, SpaceX has performed several high-altitude flight tests with the Starship prototypes. Future plans involve orbital flight tests, before proceeding with crewed missions.

### Future Flights
The success of the integrated flight tests opens the door to more ambitious missions, including flights around the Moon, missions to Mars, and possibly even crewed missions to other destinations in the solar system.

## Results and Implications
### Technical Challenges and Solutions
The integrated flight tests of the Starship have encountered several technical challenges, including difficulties with the landing phase. However, SpaceX has shown its ability to rapidly iterate on its designs and solve these problems, with each subsequent test flight marking significant progress.

### Impact on SpaceX and Commercial Spaceflight
The successful development and testing of the Starship holds profound implications for SpaceX and the broader field of commercial spaceflight. The vehicle's reusability and large payload capacity could significantly reduce the cost of space travel, potentially making it accessible to more people and organizations.

### Regulatory and Environmental Issues
The testing and eventual deployment of the Starship raise several regulatory and environmental issues. SpaceX must comply with international space law and regulations governing launch licenses, while also mitigating the environmental impact of rocket launches.
