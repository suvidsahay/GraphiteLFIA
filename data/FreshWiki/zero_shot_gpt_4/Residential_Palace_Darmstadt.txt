### Overview
The Residential Palace, also known as the 'Residenzschloss Darmstadt,' served as the ducal residence of the Grand Dukes of Hesse. Built on the foundation of the medieval castle, it boasts a fascinating amalgamation of different architectural styles, from Renaissance to Baroque to Neoclassicism. Today, it houses a university and the State Archives, continuing to serve a vital role in Darmstadt's social, cultural, and educational life.

### History
The origins of the Palace date back to the 13th century, when it was initially a castle built by the counts of Katzenelnbogen. Over the centuries, it underwent multiple renovations and extensions, reflecting the changing architectural tastes and the needs of its regal inhabitants. The current palace, predominantly Baroque in style with elements of Renaissance and Neoclassicism, was primarily shaped in the late 17th and 18th centuries.
