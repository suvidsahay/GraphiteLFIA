# Introduction

## Overview

International figure skating competitions bring together the worldâ€™s best athletes in a celebration of sport, unity, and national pride. Each year, these competitions draw in millions of viewers from around the globe. The electrifying atmosphere, the breathtaking performances, and the thrill of competition make for a spectacular event that captivates audiences of all ages.

## Host City and Venue

The hosting city for these major international competitions changes from year to year, but each city must provide a suitable venue to accommodate the events. For instance, if we consider the 2022 Figure Skating World Championships, it is set to be held in Montpellier, France at the Sud de France Arena, which has a seating capacity of 14,000. 

# Bidding Process and Selection

## Bidding Nations and Cities

The process to select a host city begins with a bidding process. Cities interested in hosting submit an official bid that outlines the city's capabilities, proposed venues, accommodation, and financial guarantees. The International Skating Union (ISU) receives bids from cities all over the world.

## Selection Process

Once the ISU receives all bids, a review process begins. The ISU will evaluate each bid based on specific criteria, such as the city's experience in hosting international events, transportation infrastructure, proposed budget, and venue capacities. After a thorough review, the ISU council votes to select the host city.

# Preparation

## Venue Preparation

After a city has been selected, preparations for the competition begin in earnest. This includes everything from preparing the ice rink, setting up spectator facilities, creating the backstage areas for athletes, and setting up media facilities. 

## Ticketing

The ticketing process is a crucial part of the preparation. The host organization decides on the ticket prices, categories, and the sale process. Usually, tickets are sold both online and offline, with discounts offered for early-bird purchases.

# Competition Schedule

## Day-by-day Summary
