# History

Miss Grand International was founded in 2013 by Nawat Itsaragrisil, a prominent Thai television host and producer. The inception of the pageant occurred during a period of political turmoil in Thailand, which inspired the organizers to adopt the slogan \"No mob, Stop the Wars\" as a core part of its identity. This slogan was later rephrased to \"Stop the War and Violence\" in subsequent years, emphasizing the pageant's commitment to promoting peace and opposing all forms of conflict[3][13][14].
The pageant has evolved since its establishment, becoming a significant platform for advocating social issues, particularly those related to peace and non-violence. In addition to its peace-oriented mission, Miss Grand International has expanded its reach globally, with national licensees organizing preliminary pageants in various countries to select representatives for the international competition[3][15][16].

# Selection Process

The selection process for Miss Grand International 2022 involved multiple stages to determine the finalists. Initially, twenty semi-finalists were chosen by a selection committee from a larger pool of contestants[17]. These contestants were selected by the franchise holder in their respective countries or territories, either through national contests, internal casting, or being hand-picked. In the early years of the pageant, many participants were appointed directly, as there were often no national pageants held[18][19].
During the grand final, the contestants participated in various competitions, including speech and evening gown rounds. Following these segments, the judges selected the top five contestants to advance to the question-and-answer portion of the competition. Here, all finalists were posed the same question related to current global issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2016 United States presidential election, and the political crisis in Venezuela[6][20]. The judges evaluated their responses alongside previous scores from other segments to determine the winner and the runners-up[9][21].
Additionally, the selection of the top 20 finalists during the grand final was influenced by scores accumulated from ancillary events, preliminary competitions, a closed-door interview, and a swimsuit competition[22][13]. This comprehensive selection process aimed to identify a well-rounded representative for the title of Miss Grand International.

Contestants are often engaged in initiatives that reflect their commitment to social change, acting as spokespersons for various humanitarian causes throughout their reign.

## Humanitarian Engagement

The reigning titleholders dedicate their year to actively participating in charity events and campaigns related to their humanitarian focus. This involvement includes collaborating with international organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to raise funds for humanitarian aid, visiting refugee camps, and providing essential supplies to internally displaced individuals[39][33][13]. Titleholders also serve as ambassadors for various NGOs, including the Catholic Medical Mission Board and Model United Nations, and take part in local charitable projects in the countries they visit[33][13].

## Empowerment and Advocacy

Beyond addressing immediate humanitarian needs, Miss Grand International encourages contestants to advocate for women's empowerment and social change. Initiatives aimed at education and women's rights are prioritized, with a focus on equipping young women with the tools to become leaders and change-makers in their communities[11][40].

# Challenges Faced

The Miss Grand International pageant has encountered a variety of challenges throughout its history, particularly concerning contestant safety and logistical issues. In 2019, the event was scheduled to take place in Venezuela during a period of intense political crisis. This situation led to several contestants withdrawing from the competition due to security concerns and visa regulation problems, affecting participants from countries such as South Korea, Cambodia, and Laos[20][41].
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant hurdles for the organization of the event. Originally set for October 25, 2020, in Venezuela, the pageant was postponed until 2021 and relocated to Bangkok, Thailand, highlighting the ongoing impact of global health crises on international events[17][42].
Moreover, the competition's reliance on local licensees to select contestants has introduced complexities regarding the consistency of participation and representation from various countries, further complicating the organization and promotion of the pageant on a global scale[43].

# Controversies

The Miss Grand International 2022 pageant has sparked various discussions and controversies, particularly regarding its role as a platform for social change. A significant aspect of the event is its emphasis on cultural and social engagement, which has been both praised and criticized. Researchers have examined the perceptions of contestants as agents of change, suggesting that their involvement can significantly influence public discourse on social issues[8][25].
One point of contention involves the direction of contest promotions towards specific social causes, which some argue may overshadow the pageant's traditional focus on beauty and talent. Critics contend that while promoting social objectives is commendable, it may dilute the original intent of beauty pageants[8].
Moreover, the implications of cultural communication methods used during the event have also come under scrutiny. The study suggests that these methods affect how individuals convey and establish cultural objectives, raising questions about authenticity and representation in such contexts[8][25].
As Miss Grand International seeks to blend glamour with activism, the balance between entertainment and meaningful advocacy remains a contentious issue within the realm of beauty pageants.
