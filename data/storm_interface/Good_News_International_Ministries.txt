Good News International Ministries (GNIM) emphasizes a strict adherence to its Statement of Faith, which is deemed essential for maintaining the integrity of the organization as a Church of Jesus Christ. All individuals employed in any capacity, as well as members of the Leadership Team, Staff, Directors, and Teachers, are required to agree with and abide by this Statement of Faith to serve within the ministry effectively[24][18].

## Faith

The ministry defines faith as both a belief and trust in the gospel, specifically the belief that Jesus died for humanity's sins.
1. **Intellectual Belief**: This aspect refers to the knowledge and acceptance of the good news, supported by scriptural references such as 1 John 5:10.
2. **Moral Belief**: This involves acting in accordance with God's teachings; the ministry asserts that faith without action is not acceptable to God, as highlighted in James 2:17[24][22].

## Repentance

Repentance is considered a fundamental aspect of GNIM's beliefs. It is described as a comprehensive change of heart and mind, shifting away from sin and toward God. This process is not merely about feeling remorseful for one's sins but represents a complete turnaround in one’s life[24][18][22].

## Teachings on Modernity and the End Times

Notably, predictions of apocalyptic events, such as the alleged prophecy that the world would end on April 15, 2023, have been associated with some of its teachings[25].

# Programs and Services

## Mission and Outreach

Good News Club Ministries International (GNCMI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing a coordinated system of religious services, including various outreach programs aimed at impacting communities positively[16]. The organization's mission is to share the gospel while offering support and resources to local congregations.

## Educational Resources

GNCMI provides a wealth of resources aimed at enhancing the church experience for various age groups. Ministries such as Teen Mission and Young Evangelical Fellowship (YEF) have been tasked with developing practical strategies and resources tailored for different demographics within the church. This approach aims to ensure inclusivity and active participation across all age groups, fostering a balanced and welcoming environment for everyone[7][26].

### Specialized Programs

To cater to the diverse needs of communities, GNCMI has initiated specific programs designed to address health and wellness concerns. For example, the GoodNEWS Trial focuses on reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors among African-American church congregations by implementing health promotion strategies combined with maintenance interventions[27].

# Fundraising Strategies

Good News International Ministries employs a variety of fundraising strategies to support its mission and community initiatives. These strategies not only aim to raise funds but also engage congregants and the broader community in meaningful ways.

## Crowdfunding

One of the most recognized methods for raising funds is crowdfunding. This approach allows the ministry to set up campaigns on popular platforms such as GoFundMe, Kickstarter, or Indiegogo. By leveraging social media and the personal networks of congregants, the ministry can reach a wider audience and gather support for specific causes important to the community.[28]

## Community Events

Hosting community events is another effective fundraising strategy. For example, launching events that encourage participation, such as fitness challenges or farmer's markets, can foster community spirit while generating funds. These events not only promote health and wellness but also encourage members to share their experiences on social media, creating a sense of camaraderie and excitement around the ministry’s goals.[29]

## Direct Mail Campaigns

Direct mail campaigns have proven to be an effective way to solicit donations. By crafting personalized letters that articulate the ministry's needs and mission, Good News International Ministries can reach out to its members and the community, encouraging them to contribute financially. This strategy allows for direct engagement with potential donors without the need for an event, making it a flexible fundraising option.[30]

## Donation Kiosks

Incorporating donation kiosks within the church premises offers an easy and secure way for congregants to contribute. These kiosks are equipped with online donation software that allows members to make quick contributions during their visits to the church, thereby simplifying the giving process and encouraging more frequent donations.[31]

## Church Cookbook

Creating a church cookbook is another unique approach to fundraising. This endeavor involves gathering beloved recipes from church members, fostering a sense of community while providing a product that can be sold. The cookbook not only serves as a fundraiser but also as a keepsake that strengthens the bonds among members through shared culinary traditions.[29]

## Scriptural Inspiration

Throughout these fundraising efforts, the ministry emphasizes the spiritual aspect of giving, aligning with teachings such as those found in 2 Corinthians 9:6-8. This scripture underscores the importance of generous giving and encourages members to contribute joyfully and without reluctance, further reinforcing the community's commitment to support both the church and local outreach efforts.[32]

The organization aims to share the Good News of Christianity by focusing on strategic evangelism and providing effective resources to enhance disciple-making efforts[12][41].

# Criticism and Controversies

Good News International Ministries has faced significant scrutiny and criticism regarding its practices and beliefs. The organization has been accused of promoting harmful ideologies and engaging in activities that have drawn public ire.

## Allegations of Harmful Practices

In a recent case, autopsies on over 100 bodies revealed that the victims had died from starvation, strangulation, suffocation, and blunt force injuries. This disturbing discovery led to a nationwide police investigation into various religious leaders whose teachings were perceived as misleading and potentially violating human rights[5][6]. President William Ruto established a commission of inquiry to probe the circumstances surrounding these deaths, aiming to recommend stricter regulations on religious institutions across the country[5].

## Incidents of Violence

One notable incident involving members of Good News International Ministries occurred in October 2018, known as the Ink Attack Incident. Members of the organization were arrested after violently attacking the offices of Hyundae Jongyo, a magazine that specializes in cult-related issues. The assailants threw eggs and splashed ink in a display of aggression, resulting in civil and criminal charges against them[8][7].

## Questionable Ideologies

The organization's teachings have also been criticized for their rejection of \"Western values,\" labeling aspects such as healthcare, education, and sports as \"evils of western life\"[9]. This perspective raises concerns about the potential influence of these beliefs on the followers' well-being and integration into broader society.

## Regulatory Concerns

In light of these controversies, calls for stricter oversight of religious organizations have intensified. Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki stated that the tragic events surrounding the recent fatalities must result in severe consequences for the perpetrators and tighter regulation, including self-regulation, for all places of worship[5][10]. This situation underscores ongoing concerns about the accountability of religious groups and their impact on public safety and human rights.
