# History

The Georgia Guidestones, often referred to as \"America's Stonehenge,\" were commissioned in 1979 by an individual using the pseudonym R.C. Christian. The monument was erected in Elberton, Georgia, and comprises six granite slabs inscribed with ten guidelines for humanity, written in eight languages. The construction process involved extensive planning and heavy machinery; a 100-foot crane was used to position the massive stones, which totaled nearly 240,000 pounds in weight.[1]

## Construction and Design

Construction began in early 1980, following meticulous preparation of the site at Double 7 hilltop. The Guidestones were designed in a paddle-wheel layout with each outer rock measuring approximately 16 feet 4 inches high and the center column being slightly narrower. The monument also features a capstone that is 9 feet 8 inches long.[1] The site was intended to provide guidance for future generations in the event of a catastrophic global event, with messages advocating for rational thought and sustainability amidst potential societal collapse.[1]

## Vandalism and Controversy

Over the years, the Guidestones have sparked a range of reactions from the public, from admiration to vehement opposition. Some view the inscriptions as a rational call to action, while others consider them ominous and linked to conspiracy theories regarding a New World Order.[1][3] In July 2022, the monument was heavily vandalized when one of its vertical granite panels was destroyed by explosives. Subsequently, authorities demolished the remaining structure \"for safety reasons,\" marking the end of an enigmatic chapter in American history.[3]
The ongoing controversies surrounding the Guidestones highlight a societal struggle to interpret their messages amidst fears of global governance and loss of individual freedoms. This duality of perception—where some celebrate them as symbols of enlightenment and others condemn them as manifestations of apocalyptic thinking—continues to fuel discussions about their true intent and legacy.[1]
