# Summary

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is the 68th edition of the annual international song competition, set to take place in Malmö, Sweden. This will be the third time Malmö has hosted the event, with previous occasions in 1992 and 2013. The contest will be held at the Malmö Arena, a venue renowned for its capacity to accommodate large-scale events, including up to 15,000 spectators. The semi-finals are scheduled for May 7 and May 9, 2024, with the grand final on May 11, 2024[1][2]. 
Malmö's selection as the host city follows Sweden's victory in the previous year's contest. The city will enhance the event experience with various side activities, including the Eurovision Village at Folkets Park, where live performances and screenings will create a festive atmosphere[3]. Petra Mede and Malin Åkerman have been announced as the presenters, bringing a blend of experienced Eurovision hosting and international appeal[3]. 
This year's contest continues to employ the semi-final format introduced in 2004, with 37 participating countries, including the \"Big Five\" who automatically qualify for the final. The competition will feature a diverse range of musical genres, as is customary for Eurovision, and will also maintain its tradition of elaborate stage shows and distinctive postcards, which this year will include selfie-mode footage from the artists and archival clips of previous entries[2][4].
Despite its global popularity, Eurovision has not been without controversy. This year, political tensions, particularly surrounding Israel's participation due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, have sparked debates and calls for boycotts. Moreover, accusations of unprofessional behavior and harassment at related events have led to an independent investigation and subsequent organizational changes within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)[4]. These elements underscore the complex interplay of cultural, social, and political factors that continue to shape the Eurovision Song Contest.

# Location and Date

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 will be held in Malmö, Sweden, marking the third time the city has hosted the event, with previous occasions being in 1992 and 2013. The contest will take place at the Malmö Arena, a modern venue known for its capacity to host large-scale events and concerts. The event will span over several days, with the semi-finals scheduled for May 7 and May 9, 2024, and the grand final set for May 11, 2024. The Malmö Arena can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators, meeting the Eurovision Song Contest's requirement for a host venue capable of seating at least 10,000 attendees and providing sufficient facilities for press and delegations[1][2].
In addition to the main event, the city of Malmö will organise various side events to enhance the experience for both locals and visitors. These will include the Eurovision Village, which will be located at Folkets Park. The Eurovision Village will feature live performances by contest participants and local artists, as well as screenings of the live shows, creating a festive atmosphere throughout the city[3]. The official opening ceremony and red carpet procession will also take place at a notable venue within the city, a tradition that has been part of the Eurovision Song Contest since 2009[1][2].

# Format

## Postcards

The \"postcards\" are short video introductions shown on television while the stage is being prepared for the next entry. Filmed from November 2023 to May 2024, the postcards are composed of footage shot by the participating artists through \"selfie-mode,\" introducing the artists themselves and the country they represent. Each postcard also features archival footage of two of a country's previous entries[4]. An individual theme is utilized by contest producers when constructing the visual identity of each edition of the contest, including the stage design, the opening and interval acts, and the \"postcards\"[2].

## Presenters

Swedish comedian and television host Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Åkerman were announced as the presenters of the 2024 contest on 5 February 2024. Mede had previously hosted both the 2013 and 2016 editions (solo and with Måns Zelmerlöw, respectively), as well as the 2015 special anniversary program \"Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits\" alongside Graham Norton. Jovan Radomir will moderate the contest's press conferences[3].

## Detailed Results

### Semi-final 1

The ten qualifiers from the first semi-final were determined solely by televoting. All fifteen countries competing in the first semi-final voted, alongside Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the aggregated Rest of the World vote. The ten qualifying countries were announced in no particular order, and the full results were published after the final was held[4].

### Semi-final 2

The draw to determine the participating countries' semi-finals took place on 30 January 2024. The thirty-one semi-finalists were divided over five pots based on historical voting patterns, with the purpose of reducing the chance of bloc voting and increasing suspense in the semi-finals. The draw also determined which semi-final each of the six automatic qualifiers would vote in and be required to broadcast[3]. At the second semi-final on Thursday, another 16 countries gave their all on stage. The ten that were voted through as finalists are: Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Armenia, Latvia, Georgia, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands. The six that were eliminated were Albania, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Malta, and San Marino[5].

### Grand Final

The Eurovision 2024 Grand Final took place on Saturday, May 11. All countries voted with the Rest of the World aggregate vote added as an extra set of televotes. A total of 26 countries performed on Saturday night[5].

## Interval Acts and Guest Appearances

During the interval of the final, the postcards were parodied by presenter Petra Mede, with archival footage from her previous hostings in 2013 and 2016 being featured[4].

# Participants

## Qualification and Semi-finals

Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, the Eurovision Song Contest has implemented a system where countries must qualify through semi-finals to reach the grand final. This format was introduced to accommodate an influx of new countries applying for the 2003 contest, transforming the event into a two-day spectacle. In the current system, the remaining countries are divided between two semi-finals, and the ten highest-scoring entries from each semi-final qualify, resulting in 26 countries competing in the final[2]. Notably, Luxembourg and Ukraine are the only countries outside the \"Big Five\" to have qualified for the final in every contest they have competed in since the semi-final's introduction[2].

## Historic Participation and Relegation

The Eurovision Song Contest began with just seven countries in its inaugural event. Over the years, participation has expanded significantly. By 1961, three new countries—Finland, Spain, and Yugoslavia—joined the contest, which had already grown to thirteen entries[6]. Yugoslavia stood out as the only socialist country to participate for the next three decades[6].
In 1993, following the collapse of the USSR and the merger of the EBU and the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), several new broadcasters were able to compete, leading to the debut of countries like Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina[6]. These countries initially went through a pre-qualifier round to earn their spots[6]. After this event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing more Eastern European countries to enter the competition. This system was used again between 2001 and 2003[6].
Since 1999, the winning country from the previous year automatically qualifies for the final, along with the \"Big Four/Five\"—the largest financial contributors to the EBU, which include Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom[6]. Starting in 2008, two semi-finals were established, with all countries except the previous year's winner and the \"Big Four/Five\" participating in one of the semi-finals to qualify for the final[6].

## Notable Participants

Throughout its history, the Eurovision Song Contest has seen performances by several best-selling music artists, including ABBA, Celine Dion, Julio Iglesias, Cliff Richard, and Olivia Newton-John. Some of the world's best-selling singles received their first international performance on the Eurovision stage[2].
Furthermore, several artists have competed in the contest after achieving considerable success, such as Lulu, Toto Cutugno, Katrina and the Waves, Nana Mouskouri, Cliff Richard, Baccara, Umberto Tozzi, Plastic Bertrand, t.A.T.u., Las Ketchup, Patricia Kaas, Engelbert Humperdinck, Bonnie Tyler, and Flo Rida[2]. The contest has also featured guest performances by renowned groups and individuals, such as Cirque du Soleil, Alexandrov Ensemble, the Vienna Boys' Choir, and Fire of Anatolia, as well as appearances by international stars like Justin Timberlake and Madonna[2].

## Non-European Participants

Eligibility for the Eurovision Song Contest is not restricted to European countries. Over the years, countries from Western Asia, such as Israel and Cyprus, as well as transcontinental countries like Russia and Turkey, and even a North African country, Morocco, have participated[2].

# Preparation

## Pre-Parties

In the run-up to each year's Eurovision Song Contest, several countries regularly host smaller events known as \"pre-parties\". These events typically take place between the conclusion of national selection shows in March and the main contest in May. The pre-parties feature performances by the artists who will compete in the contest and include meet-and-greet sessions with fans and the press. One of the first pre-party events was Eurovision in Concert, held annually in Amsterdam since its inception in 2008. Other notable events include the London Eurovision Party, PrePartyES in Madrid, and Israel Calling in Tel Aviv. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in 2020, several community events have also been held virtually, such as EurovisionAgain, where fans watch and discuss past contests synchronously on YouTube and other social media platforms[2].

## Host City and Venue

Preparations at the host venue typically begin approximately six weeks before the final event. This period allows for the necessary building works and technical rehearsals before the arrival of the competing artists. Delegations usually arrive in the host city two to three weeks before the live show. Each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, who is responsible for coordinating the movements of their delegation and acting as the country's representative to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Members of each country's delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, members of the press, and, historically, a conductor if a live orchestra was present. Commentators are also present to provide live commentary of the event for their country's radio and/or television feed from dedicated booths situated around the back of the arena[2].
The host broadcaster selects the host city, which is typically a national or regional capital and must meet specific criteria set out in the contest's rules. The venue must be able to accommodate at least 10,000 spectators, have a press center for 1,500 journalists, be within easy reach of an international airport, and offer hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists, and spectators. Various venues have been used in past editions, ranging from small theatres and television studios to large arenas and stadiums. The largest host venue was Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, which hosted nearly 38,000 spectators in 2001. The smallest hosting settlement was Millstreet, Ireland, with a population of 1,500 at the time of the 1993 contest, though its Green Glens Arena could host up to 8,000 spectators[2].

## Technical Preparations

The technical preparations for the Eurovision Song Contest involve extensive planning and coordination. For the 2024 contest at Malmö Arena, the technical setup included sophisticated audio, video, and lighting technology. Audio delivery was managed through two Stagetec Avatus consoles fed from two Stagetec Nexus Matrices, processing almost 100 channels of audio. Monitor systems included dual redundant DigiCo Quantum 7’s and SD-racks, with a fully redundant signal distribution system using Direct Out Prodigy’s and M1K2’s. This setup ensured a seamless and high-quality audio experience for both the performers and the audience[7][8][9][10].

# Event

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 hosted several pre-contest events and ceremonies, following traditions established over the years. An official opening ceremony, featuring a red carpet procession, was held on 5 May 2024 at the Malmö Live event centre, presenting the contestants and their delegations before accredited press and fans[1]. Since 2009, this red carpet procession has become a staple of the event, replacing the previous welcome reception typically hosted by the mayor of the host city.

## Pre-Parties and Community Events

In the months leading up to the contest, several countries hosted smaller events known as \"pre-parties.\" These events, including Eurovision in Concert in Amsterdam, the London Eurovision Party, PrePartyES in Madrid, and Israel Calling in Tel Aviv, allowed participating artists to perform and engage with fans and media[2]. Additionally, community events such as EurovisionAgain provided virtual engagement opportunities for fans, especially notable during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Venue Preparations

Preparations for the contest began approximately six weeks before the final to accommodate building works and technical rehearsals. Delegations typically arrived in the host city two to three weeks before the live show. Each participating broadcaster nominated a head of delegation to coordinate movements and represent their country to the EBU. Team members included performers, composers, lyricists, press members, and, in earlier years, a conductor[2].

## Broadcasting Requirements

Participating broadcasters were required to air live the semi-final in which they competed or voted and the final in its entirety, including all competing songs and the voting procedure. Since 1999, broadcasters were allowed to provide advertising during short hiatuses in the show’s schedule. However, in exceptional circumstances like emergencies, broadcasts could be delayed or postponed[2].

## Opening Acts and Interval Performances

Each show began with an opening act consisting of music and/or dance performances by invited artists, contributing to a unique theme and identity for that year's event. Since 2013, the contest's final has included a \"Flag Parade,\" with competing artists entering the stage behind their country's flag, similar to the Olympic Games opening ceremony[2]. The opening and interval acts have featured both internationally known artists and local stars, serving as memorable highlights of the contest. Past acts have included Cirque du Soleil, Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Mika, and Rita Ora, among others[2].

## Semi-Finals

The first semi-final took place on 7 May 2024 at 21:00 CEST, featuring fifteen competing countries along with Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and non-participating countries under an aggregated \"Rest of the World\" vote. The ten qualifiers, including Croatia, Ukraine, and Ireland, were announced in no particular order, with the full results published after the final[4].
The second semi-final occurred on 9 May 2024 at 21:00 CEST, with sixteen competing countries and additional votes from France. The results of this semi-final were also determined by televoting[4].

## Additional Events and Performances

The Malmö Live event centre hosted several related events, including the \"Turquoise Carpet\" event and the opening and closing ceremonies. The venue also hosted live screenings and the EuroClub, which featured official after-parties and private performances by contest participants[4].

# Performances

Alongside the song contest and appearances from local and international personalities, performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been included since the first edition, becoming a staple of the live show. These performances have varied widely, previously featuring music, art, dance, and circus performances, with past participants regularly invited to perform. The reigning champion traditionally returns each year to perform the previous year's winning song[2]. A number of performers have competed in the contest after having already achieved considerable success, including winning artists Lulu, Toto Cutugno, and Katrina and the Waves, as well as acts that did not win, such as Nana Mouskouri, Cliff Richard, Baccara, Umberto Tozzi, Plastic Bertrand, t.A.T.u., Las Ketchup, Patricia Kaas, Engelbert Humperdinck, Bonnie Tyler, and Flo Rida[2]. Renowned composers and lyricists such as Serge Gainsbourg, Goran Bregović, Diane Warren, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Pete Waterman, and Tony Iommi, along with producers Timbaland and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, have also penned entries over the years[2].
Each contest edition is characterized by an individual theme, which informs the visual identity including stage design, opening and interval acts, and the \"postcards\" that introduce the competing acts. These short video postcards, first introduced in 1970, were initially a method to extend the show's duration but have since become a regular feature, highlighting the host country and the artists. A unique slogan for each edition, first introduced in 2002, was replaced by a permanent slogan \"United by Music\" from 2024 onwards, which had been used for the 2023 contest and retained as part of the contest's global brand strategy[2].
Each show typically starts with an opening act that features music and/or dance performances by invited artists, contributing to the event's unique theme and identity. Since 2013, the final's opening has included a \"Flag Parade,\" where competing artists enter the stage behind their country's flag, akin to the Olympic Games' opening ceremony. Presenters welcome viewers, provide updates, conduct interviews, and guide the voting process in English and French. After all competing acts perform, viewers vote for their favorite performances via telephone, SMS, and the official Eurovision app, with the public vote comprising 50% of the final result alongside a jury of music industry professionals from each country[2]. An interval act is featured during the voting period, often including well-known personalities. Results are announced with the top-ranked countries in the semi-finals and a detailed reveal in the final[2].
Originally a single evening event, the contest has expanded with new countries joining, including non-European nations like Israel and Australia. This growth led to the introduction of relegation procedures in the 1990s and the creation of semi-finals in the 2000s. As of 2024, Germany has competed the most times, participating in all but one edition, while Ireland and Sweden hold the record for the most victories, each with seven wins[2]. The contest's opening performance and the interval act before the voting results have become memorable aspects, featuring internationally known artists and local stars. These performances often explore the host country's culture and history or provide comedic relief, such as \"Love Love Peace Peace\" in 2016, a humorous homage to the contest's history and spectacle[2].

# Results

The results of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 were determined by a combination of televoting and jury voting from all thirty-seven participating countries, along with an aggregate public vote from the Rest of the World[4][2]. Each country's spokesperson announced their jury's favorite entry that received 12 points, while the remaining points were displayed on screen[4]. After the jury points were announced, the public points were revealed by the contest hosts in ascending order, starting with the country that received the fewest jury points[4][2].

## Semi-final 1

The first semi-final took place on 7 May 2024 and included fifteen competing countries. The qualifiers were determined solely by televoting from these countries, as well as from Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the aggregated Rest of the World vote[4]. The ten qualifying countries were announced in no particular order, with the detailed results published after the final[4]. Croatia received the maximum score of 12 points from eight countries, while Ukraine received five sets of 12 points. Lithuania and Cyprus each received two sets of 12 points, and Portugal and Serbia received one each[4].

## Semi-final 2

The second semi-final was held on 9 May 2024, with France, Italy, Spain, and the Rest of the World voting alongside the competing countries[4]. The detailed results for the second semi-final, including the televoting and jury points, were also made available on the official Eurovision website after the final[2].

## Grand Final

The grand final took place on 11 May 2024. All participating countries, along with the Rest of the World, voted in this final[4]. The final results combined both jury and public votes, which were revealed in the same manner as the semi-finals[2]. Sweden's position in the running order was determined during the Head of Delegations meeting in March 2024[4].
The winning artists and songwriters received a trophy, a handmade piece of sandblasted glass designed by Kjell Engman, presented by the previous year's winner[2]. The full breakdown of the results, including individual televoting points and jury votes, was published on the official Eurovision website shortly after the final[2].

# Broadcast

Participating broadcasters are required to air live the semi-final in which they compete or, in the case of the automatic finalists, the semi-final in which they are required to vote, and the final in its entirety. This includes all competing songs, the voting recap containing short clips of the performances, the voting procedure or semi-final qualification reveal, and the reprise of the winning song in the final[2]. Since 1999, broadcasters wishing to do so have been given the opportunity to provide advertising during short, non-essential hiatuses in the show's schedule[2]. In exceptional circumstances, such as developing emergency situations, participating broadcasters may delay or postpone the broadcast of the event without facing sanctions. For instance, in 2000, the contest in the Netherlands was interrupted to provide emergency news coverage of the Enschede fireworks disaster, resulting in the use of a backup jury for the country's points[11]. Similarly, in 2012, Albania deferred the broadcast of the first semi-final to cover the Qafa e Vishës bus accident[11]. However, in 2009, Spain faced sanctions for deferring the broadcast of the second semi-final to continue coverage of the Madrid Open tennis tournament[11].
All participating broadcasters may choose to have on-site or remote commentators providing insight and voting information to their local audience[3]. While they must broadcast at least the semi-final they are voting in and the final, most broadcasters air all three shows with different programming plans[3]. Additionally, some non-participating broadcasters air the contest, and the Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel provides international live streams with no commentary of all shows[3][4]. For instance, RTL provided a wide array of broadcast options through television, radio, and online streaming, with English, French, and Luxembourgish language commentators recruited for the live shows upon its return to the contest in 2024[12].
The Eurovision Song Contest has a significant global viewership, with a total of 163 million people watching at least a minute of the television broadcasts and 7.3 million people watching the YouTube broadcasts in recent years[4]. Votes were received from 156 countries, including the 37 competing countries[4]. In the United States, the competition is aired on the streaming service Peacock, and viewers in both participating and nonparticipating countries can vote online or using the Eurovision app[13].
Sponsors have also actively engaged with the event. For example, EasyJet took over travel sponsorship this year, leveraging the event in its communications[14]. Additionally, brands like Diageo have focused on accessibility by offering audio description tracks on platforms like Spotify and Instagram to enhance the viewing experience for those with visual impairments[14].

# Controversies and Incidents

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 witnessed several controversies and incidents, reflecting ongoing political tensions and differing viewpoints among participants and observers.

## Musical Style and Presentation

While the contest has gained popularity for its camp appeal and diverse musical styles, it has faced criticism for its artistic quality and an over-abundance of elaborate stage shows at the cost of artistic merit[2]. Despite these criticisms, the contest remains a significant cultural event, celebrated for its inclusion of various musical genres including rock, heavy metal, jazz, country, electronic, R\u0026B, hip hop, and avant-garde[2].

## Political Controversies

### Israeli Participation

The participation of Israel has been a consistent point of contention. In 2024, calls for Israel to be excluded from the contest arose due to the Israel–Hamas war. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) rejected these calls, leading to various campaigns for participants and viewers to boycott the contest[4]. The Israeli national selection faced its own controversy, as the original lyrics of the song \"October Rain\" were seen as referencing the 7 October attacks, leading to a rewrite and retitle of the song to \"Hurricane\"[4]. Despite these issues, Israel placed second in the televote and fifth overall in the final, a result partially attributed to a campaign by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs to boost public votes[4].

### Audience Reactions and Delegation Complaints

During the contest, incidents of harassment and unprofessional behavior were reported. Members of Israeli fan clubs were accused of harassing the Irish delegation at the EuroClub nightclub, and videos circulated online showing alleged harassment by Israeli delegates and journalists[4]. Complaints were lodged by various delegations, leading to an independent investigation by the EBU[4]. Organizational changes were subsequently announced, including the creation of a \"ESC director\" role and recommendations for appointing a welfare producer and a crisis management team[4].

### Claims of Audience Audio Changes

Several countries, including Greece, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, considered withdrawing from the final due to an \"unsafe environment in the arena\" and other contentious issues. However, an agreement was reached with the EBU 25 minutes prior to the start of the show, allowing the contest to proceed without these withdrawals[4].

## Petition for Lithuania's Withdrawal

Lithuania faced its own internal controversy, with a petition demanding the country's withdrawal from the contest. The petition, sponsored by right-wing populist MEP Petras Gražulis, cited the cost of the contest and the prominence of LGBT persons as reasons for withdrawal[15]. However, LRT, Lithuania’s public service broadcaster, responded to the petition, noting that the People and Justice Union is only represented by Gražulis in the European Parliament, severely limiting the impact of any desire to withdraw[15].
These controversies highlight the complex interplay of political, cultural, and social factors that continue to shape the Eurovision Song Contest, reflecting broader tensions and issues within the participating countries and beyond.

# Reception

While the Eurovision Song Contest has garnered widespread popularity among viewers in both participating and non-participating countries, it has not been immune to criticism. Concerns have been raised regarding the event's artistic quality and the perceived political dimensions that might influence the results. Political alliances and rivalries between countries have been suspected of impacting the voting outcomes, which has sparked debates and controversies over the fairness of the competition[2]. Instances of countries withdrawing from the contest at late stages, censorship of broadcast segments, and political events affecting participation have further fueled such criticisms. Additionally, the contest has faced accusations of prioritizing elaborate stage productions over artistic merit[2].
Despite these criticisms, Eurovision has thrived, largely due to its camp appeal, the diverse range of ethnic and international music styles it showcases, and its significant role within the LGBT community. This vibrant mix has fostered a large, active fanbase and has left an indelible mark on popular culture[2].
The preparation for the event is an extensive process, typically starting around six weeks before the final to accommodate the necessary building works and technical rehearsals. Competing delegations usually arrive two to three weeks before the live show, with each broadcaster nominating a head of delegation to oversee their country's participation and represent them to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)[2]. Members of each delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, press, and sometimes a conductor, if a live orchestra is used. Commentators, who provide coverage in their native languages, are also part of the setup, working from dedicated booths around the arena[2].
Since 1957, the announcement of each country's votes has been a highlight of the broadcast, with spokespersons—often celebrities or former Eurovision artists—revealing the results. This process has evolved from audio-only telephone announcements to visual satellite links introduced in 1994, allowing spokespersons to be seen on screen[1].
An array of related events and activities also contributes to the contest's appeal. A welcome reception, typically featuring a red carpet ceremony, is held in the host city on the Sunday before the live shows. This event, broadcast online, includes performances and gatherings for accredited delegates, press, and fans. Additionally, the \"EuroClub\" and the \"Eurovision Village\" provide spaces for after-parties and public fan zones, respectively[2].
These elements combine to create an event that, despite its controversies, continues to captivate and entertain millions of viewers around the world, celebrating music and cultural diversity on an unprecedented scale.

# Legacy

The Eurovision Song Contest has consistently gained popularity among the viewing public, not only in participating countries but also in non-participating ones. Despite this widespread popularity, the contest has faced criticism regarding its artistic quality and perceived political bias. Concerns have been raised about how political friendships and rivalries between countries may influence the results. Over the years, the contest has seen several controversial moments, such as countries withdrawing at the last minute, broadcasters censoring segments, and political events affecting participation. Furthermore, some have criticized the contest for prioritizing elaborate stage shows over artistic merit. Nonetheless, Eurovision has carved out a unique niche, particularly for its camp appeal, diverse musical styles, and its role within LGBT culture, thus cultivating a large, active fanbase and significant influence on popular culture[2].
One enduring tradition of the contest is that the winning country hosts the event the following year, with some exceptions since 1958. Hosting the contest offers a unique opportunity for the host country to promote itself as a tourist destination and benefit its local economy. However, there's a perception in popular culture that some countries may deliberately send sub-par entries to avoid the costly burden of hosting. This notion is reflected in the film \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\" (2020) and in the \"Father Ted\" episode \"A Song for Europe\" (1996). Preparations for each year's contest typically begin immediately after the previous year's event, with the winning country's head of delegation receiving a welcome package of information at the winner's press conference[2].
Performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been a staple of the live show since the first edition. These performances have included a wide variety of acts, from music and dance to circus acts and art performances. Past participants often return to perform, and the reigning champion traditionally performs the previous year's winning song. While these traits are sometimes ridiculed, they are celebrated by others and considered integral to the contest's appeal. Eurovision has showcased a diverse range of musical styles, including rock, heavy metal, jazz, country, electronic, R\u0026B, hip-hop, and avant-garde[2].
Political controversies have also been part of Eurovision's legacy. Artists and songs represent their countries, leading to several instances where political tensions between competing nations, sometimes due to frozen conflicts or open warfare, have been reflected in the performances and voting[2].
Over the years, many well-known performers and composers have participated in Eurovision, adding to its legacy. Winning artists like Lulu, Toto Cutugno, and Katrina and the Waves have graced the stage, along with unsuccessful yet notable acts such as Nana Mouskouri, Cliff Richard, and Las Ketchup. Esteemed composers and producers, including Serge Gainsbourg, Diane Warren, and Timbaland, have also contributed to the contest[2].
Each edition of the contest has a unique theme and visual identity, which includes stage design, opening and interval acts, and \"postcards\" – short video segments introducing each act. These postcards were first introduced in 1970 and have since become a regular feature. Starting in 2002, each edition also featured a unique slogan, which was replaced by the permanent slogan \"United by Music\" from 2024 onwards[2].
Among the various notable guest performances, Danish Europop group Aqua, Russian pop duo t.A.T.u., and American entertainers Justin Timberlake and Madonna have performed on the Eurovision stage.
