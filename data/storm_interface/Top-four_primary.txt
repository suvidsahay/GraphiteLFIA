# summary

The top-four primary system, also known as the final-four or final-five primary, is an electoral reform that seeks to enhance competition and inclusivity in the electoral process by allowing all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, to compete in a single primary election. Established to address perceived deficiencies in traditional partisan primaries, this system enables the top four candidates who receive the most votes to advance to the general election, regardless of whether a candidate achieves a majority in the initial round.[1][2] First proposed by Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter in their 2017 report \"Why Competition in the Politics Industry is Failing America,\" the model has gained traction among various advocacy groups, notably FairVote, since its introduction in 2012.[1][3]
One significant implementation of the top-four primary occurred during Alaska's 2022 special election, marking a pivotal moment in its adoption.[2] Proponents argue that this system can lead to increased voter engagement, particularly among independent voters, by allowing them to participate without the constraints of party affiliation.[4] Furthermore, the framework is designed to foster moderation and bipartisanship, as candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broader range of voters, potentially mitigating political polarization.[5] 
Despite its intended benefits, the top-four primary system has faced criticisms and challenges. Some argue that it may inadvertently lead to confusion among voters, especially when combined with ranked-choice voting, resulting in decision paralysis or increased error rates during elections.[6][7] Additionally, the effectiveness of this system can vary by region, with some areas experiencing lower voter turnout and engagement compared to traditional primaries.[8][9] Critics also raise concerns about the potential dilution of the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" arguing that the diverse candidate pool may not accurately reflect the preferences of the majority in the primary phase.[10][11]
As electoral practices continue to evolve, the future of the top-four primary system remains a contentious topic. Recent voter sentiment has shown resistance to ranked-choice voting initiatives, citing concerns over complexity and traditional voting preferences.[12][13] Moving forward, advocates for electoral reform must navigate these challenges while emphasizing clear communication to improve public understanding and acceptance of such systems.[14][15]

# Historical Development

The concept of the top-four primary system, also referred to as final-four or final-five primaries, emerged as a response to perceived shortcomings in traditional electoral practices. This electoral reform was first proposed by businessmen Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter in their 2017 report \"Why Competition in the Politics Industry is Failing America\" [1]. Advocated by FairVote since 2012, the model aimed to increase competition among candidates and ensure that the primary process better reflected the electorate's preferences.
The top-four primary system was designed to create a nonpartisan primary where all candidates compete on an equal footing, with the top four receiving the opportunity to advance to the general election. This approach is akin to a two-round system, guaranteeing that a general election follows the primary, regardless of whether a candidate secures a majority in the first round. In this format, candidates who receive at least 20% of the primary vote are ensured a place in the final round [1][2].
The system was first implemented in practice during the 2022 special election in Alaska, marking a significant step in its historical development [2]. The adoption of the top-four primary was supported by various political and civic organizations that argued it could promote bipartisanship and enhance voter choice [3]. However, the broader acceptance of similar reforms faced challenges, as seen in the 2024 elections when many voters rejected proposals for ranked-choice voting and instant runoffs, citing concerns over complexity and adherence to traditional voting practices [4][5]. These reactions highlight the ongoing dialogue around electoral reform and the need for effective communication of these concepts to the electorate.

# Structure of the Top-four Primary System

## Overview

The top-four primary system, also known as the final-four or final-five primary, is an electoral framework that employs a nonpartisan primary method characterized by multi-winner plurality in its initial phase[6][2]. This system was first conceptualized by Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter in their 2017 report \"Why Competition in the Politics Industry is Failing America,\" and it gained traction with advocacy from FairVote starting in 2012, which proposed a statutory model in 2015[2][7].

## Mechanics

### Primary Round

In a top-four primary, all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, compete in a single primary election. The top four candidates who receive the most votes advance to the general election[8]. This approach can be viewed as an adaptation of the two-round system, where the second round (the general election) is guaranteed to occur even if a candidate secures a majority of votes in the primary[6]. Notably, a candidate who obtains at least 20% of the primary votes is assured a place in the top-four[9].

### General Election

Following the primary, the general election features the four advancing candidates, providing voters with a wider array of choices compared to traditional systems[2]. This structure is designed to enhance competition and voter engagement by allowing for a more diverse candidate pool, which could lead to a majority winner in the general election, particularly if ranked ballots are utilized[10].

## Variations

One notable variation of the top-four primary system is the Final Five Voting, which allows five candidates to progress from the primary to the general election[6][2]. This variation maintains the same foundational principles but expands the number of finalists, thereby further enhancing voter choice and representation.

# Comparative Analysis

## Overview of Top-Four Primaries

Top-four primaries represent a nonpartisan electoral system where all candidates, regardless of their political affiliation, appear on a single ballot. Voters are allowed to participate irrespective of their registered party affiliation, and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. This format aims to promote inclusivity and ensure that a diverse range of candidates compete in the general election, potentially leading to a more representative political landscape[11][12].

## Advantages of Top-Four Primaries

### Increased Voter Engagement

One of the primary benefits of top-four primaries is the enfranchisement of independent voters, allowing them to participate in the electoral process without being restricted by party lines. This inclusion enhances voter choice and can lead to higher levels of engagement among the electorate[13][12]. Moreover, the system is designed to encourage candidates to appeal to a broader base, fostering a political environment that prioritizes moderate policies and bipartisanship[14].

### Political Moderation

Empirical studies indicate a correlation between nonpartisan primaries, such as the top-four system, and the election of more moderate candidates. Evidence from states like Alaska has shown that candidates who adopt centrist positions can be more successful, as they attract a wider array of voters[14]. This dynamic may contribute to a reduction in political polarization, creating a political landscape that better reflects the diverse views of the electorate.

## Challenges of Top-Four Primaries

### Voter Confusion

While expanding the candidate pool can enhance choice, it may also lead to voter confusion. With multiple candidates vying for attention, voters might experience decision paralysis, making it challenging to navigate the ballot and effectively assess each candidate's policies[15][16]. This situation can necessitate reliance on heuristics, such as name recognition or party affiliation, which may not always align with voters' values or preferences.

### Logistical Issues

The implementation of top-four primaries also presents logistical challenges. Organizing debates, ensuring equitable access to information about candidates, and designing ballots that are clear and user-friendly become increasingly complex as the number of candidates grows. These factors can hinder the overall effectiveness of the electoral process and potentially disenfranchise voters who struggle to make informed choices[15][16].

# Case Studies

## Alaska's Top-Four Primary System

In 2020, Alaska voters approved a significant electoral reform that implemented a top-four primary system combined with ranked choice voting (RCV) for general elections. This innovative approach allows all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, to appear on a single ballot during the primary election. The top four candidates who receive the most votes then advance to the general election, where voters rank their preferences among those finalists[17][18].
The introduction of this system was aimed at addressing concerns related to the traditional partisan primary structure, which critics argue often leads to the nomination of candidates who cater primarily to the ideological extremes of their respective parties. By allowing a broader spectrum of candidates to participate and ensuring that the final election includes a more diverse pool, supporters contend that the top-four primary can lead to more moderate and representative outcomes[17][3].

## California's Implementation

California has also adopted a top-two primary system, which allows the top two vote-getters from the primary election, regardless of party affiliation, to advance to the general election. This system is designed to provide voters with a greater variety of choices in the general election, as it can include candidates from multiple parties. The results of California's experience suggest that this format can occasionally lead to unexpected electoral outcomes. For instance, in some districts, voters have found themselves faced with candidates who may not be their first choice but have gained popularity as viable alternatives, thereby changing the dynamics of candidate selection[19][15].

## Comparative Outcomes

Both Alaska and California’s systems illustrate how nonpartisan primaries can lead to differing electoral outcomes compared to traditional partisan primaries. In nonpartisan systems, all candidates compete on a level playing field, which allows voters to select candidates based on individual merit rather than party loyalty. This structure aims to increase voter engagement and enhance representation by ensuring that the eventual nominees better reflect the electorate's preferences[19][15][20].
However, critics of these systems argue that they can sometimes lead to confusing or counterintuitive results, where candidates who are not the most favored can win due to tactical voting behaviors or the presence of a highly fragmented electorate. For example, it is possible for a candidate who is not anyone's first choice to emerge victorious if they are the second choice for a majority of voters. This phenomenon underscores the complexities inherent in nonpartisan primary systems, including the potential for circular ties among candidates, requiring specific rules to break such cycles[21][8].

# Impact on Voter Engagement and Turnout

The implementation of top-four primaries is believed to influence voter engagement and turnout significantly. Voter turnout rate is a key indicator of how many eligible voters participate in elections, and it can reflect the health of a democracy within a given state[22]. Evidence suggests that nonpartisan primaries, which often arise in systems like the top-four primary, tend to foster higher rates of voter participation. In 2022, approximately 37% of voters participated in these nonpartisan primaries, indicating a positive trend in engagement[23].
Demographics play a critical role in understanding voter turnout in primary elections. For instance, it has been observed that older, more affluent, and predominantly white voters are more likely to participate in elections, particularly in low turnout scenarios[24]. This trend raises concerns about the inclusivity of voter participation across diverse demographic groups. Data from recent elections show that voters aged 65 and older have accounted for 18% of total ballots returned in certain states, emphasizing the need for strategies aimed at increasing participation among younger and minority voters[24].
The top-four primary system aims to level the playing field, potentially increasing engagement from a broader range of candidates and constituents. By allowing the top four candidates—regardless of party affiliation—to advance to the general election, it can lead to more competitive and representative races, thus encouraging more voters to engage in the electoral process[25].
However, the impact of voter turnout can vary significantly by region. For example, among all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., 21 states saw increases in voter turnout between the 2018 and 2022 elections, with Oregon being a notable example as it led with the highest overall turnout rate[26]. Conversely, several states, particularly in the South, experienced declines in turnout, highlighting regional disparities in electoral engagement[27]. These findings suggest that while the top-four primary may enhance voter engagement in certain contexts, its effectiveness may depend on local political culture and demographics.

# Criticisms and Challenges

The top-four primary system has faced a variety of criticisms and challenges that reflect broader issues within the American electoral framework. One major concern is the potential for increased polarization and extremism among candidates, as some argue that the primary process incentivizes politicians to adopt more partisan positions to secure their place in the top four candidates advancing to the general election. This dynamic is part of what has been described as the \"Primary Problem,\" wherein elected officials often find it more beneficial to engage in controversy rather than pursue meaningful legislation, as the latter may provoke a primary challenge from a more partisan opponent[19][28].
Additionally, critics contend that the system can exacerbate voter confusion, particularly in jurisdictions with less informed electorates. Studies suggest that ranked-choice voting, which is sometimes implemented alongside top-four primaries, can lead to increased voter error and lower turnout, especially among marginalized communities[29]. Exit polls from various elections reveal a significant portion of the electorate expressing concerns about the complexity of the voting process, with many voters believing that current systems do not effectively serve their interests[30][31].
Furthermore, the top-four primary system has been scrutinized for potentially undermining the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" While proponents argue it enhances electoral fairness by allowing voters to choose from a broader array of candidates, critics point out that it may dilute the impact of individual votes, especially if the final candidates do not reflect the preferences of the majority of voters in the primary[32][20]. This tension between inclusivity and representative democracy remains a key issue in debates over electoral reform.

# Future Outlook

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the future of top-four primaries and ranked-choice voting (RCV) remains a subject of significant debate and varying opinions. In 2024, voters in several states largely rejected proposals to adopt RCV, with many opting to maintain traditional voting practices. Exit polls indicated that opponents of RCV often cited concerns about its complexity and potential confusion among voters, with claims that the system could violate the principle of “one person, one vote”[16][33].

## Challenges to Implementation

Despite the potential benefits of RCV, implementing this voting system is fraught with challenges. Substantial voter education is crucial to ensure constituents understand how to rank their preferences effectively and grasp the mechanics of the new voting process. Additionally, the transition to RCV may necessitate significant updates to voting infrastructure and equipment to support its unique tabulation requirements. Consequently, these factors contribute to RCV's unpopularity in some states, where it has even been prohibited altogether[10][34][35].

## Strategies for Advocacy

Advocates for electoral reform must consider the lessons learned from the recent ballot initiatives. The terminology used to describe voting systems is pivotal; voters often find phrases like “instant runoffs” more accessible and easier to understand than the term \"ranked-choice voting\" itself. Therefore, future campaigns should prioritize clear communication and utilize language that resonates with the electorate, simplifying the concepts involved in electoral reform[36][33].

## State-Specific Considerations

Looking ahead, states must recognize that there is no universal solution for primary election reform. Each state has unique political dynamics and voter populations that should be taken into account when evaluating the adoption of top-four primaries or RCV. Tailoring reform proposals to align with local values and practices will be essential for garnering voter support and ensuring effective implementation in the future[28][37].
