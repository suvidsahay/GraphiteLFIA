# Overview

The 2022 West Java earthquake resulted in considerable devastation across the affected region, including significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, along with numerous injuries and fatalities[1][2]. The geological impacts were further examined through spatio-temporal data analysis using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), which revealed substantial variations in ground deformation patterns over time. Notably, a significant subsidence event was documented in the northeastern section of the study area between December 17 and December 29, 2022, a phenomenon that was not observed in other periods[6][7].
Analysis indicated that regions consistently experiencing subsidence were primarily located to the north of the earthquake's epicenter, particularly within the Cianjur basin on the Fluvio-Volcanic Foot Plain (F4) and Alluvial Plain[8][16]. During the observed period, the data also illustrated significant uplift variations around Cugenang, with changes reaching up to 12 cm, and following a northwest-southeast orientation[17][18].
Field observations further corroborated these findings, as evident ground failures manifested as cracks in the soil and along roadways. In the Cugenang region, liquefaction was observed within thick alluvial deposits, leading to structural tilting of concrete buildings[19]. This comprehensive analysis of geological and structural impacts emphasizes the critical need for enhanced governmental preparedness and response strategies in the face of such natural disasters[2].

# Seismology

## Earthquake Mechanics

The 2022 West Java earthquake, which registered a magnitude of Mw 5.6, was characterized by a lack of surface rupture, indicating a complex network of subsurface fault mechanisms at play. Surface ruptures typically provide clear evidence of fault lines and their orientations, which are crucial for understanding earthquake dynamics[9][6]. The absence of such ruptures during this event suggests that detailed geophysical investigations are necessary to unravel the intricacies of the subsurface fault system and assess the seismic hazards in the region more comprehensively[6][15].

### Aftershock Patterns

Post-earthquake analysis revealed distinct patterns in aftershock activity. During the initial period following the mainshock, from November 11 to November 23, 2022, a total of 166 aftershocks were recorded. This was followed by a more active period from December 5 to December 17, 2022, which documented 233 aftershocks. Despite the increase in aftershock frequency in the latter period, the mean subsidence observed was lower compared to the earlier timeframe. The more significant subsidence noted between November 11 and November 23 can be attributed to the impact of the mainshock itself[3][20][21].

## Stress and Fault Dynamics

The mechanics of fault interaction and stress changes are critical to understanding the seismology of the region. Studies on static stress changes have shown that the dynamics of one earthquake can influence the occurrence and intensity of subsequent seismic events. For example, the response of seismicity to Coulomb stress triggers has been demonstrated in various case studies, indicating a significant relationship between stress alterations and aftershock sequences following major earthquakes[9][3].
The Lembang Fault, located near Bandung in West Java, is one of the active faults in the area, and its slip rate remains a subject of ongoing research. Understanding the behavior of such faults is vital for improving predictive models and enhancing earthquake preparedness strategies in the region[22][15].

# Human Impact

The 2022 West Java earthquake, which struck on November 21, 2022, had significant and devastating effects on the local population. The official government report released on December 3, 2022, indicated that at least 334 people lost their lives, while 593 others sustained severe injuries and required hospitalization[3][4]. The ongoing search and rescue operations transitioned to recovery efforts, as many individuals were found buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings[4].
The earthquake led to the displacement of over 73,800 people due to the destruction of more than 22,000 homes[12]. Displaced individuals were relocated to temporary shelters where they received essential medical assistance, food, water, and basic accommodations. Humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and the Indonesian Women's Coalition (KPI) Garut, mobilized to address the urgent needs of those affected, particularly focusing on women, children, and individuals with disabilities[5][23]. Mike Verawati, Director of KPI, emphasized the vulnerability of these groups, stating, “Many of the victims are women and children. We will act as fast as possible to help in rescue efforts now underway, and to provide aid and services to the most vulnerable people, who will be affected both physically and emotionally”[10][3].
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, organizations such as Americares deployed emergency response teams to the region, providing critically needed medical supplies and assessing local health needs[4][24]. Additionally, efforts were made to build evacuation camps and conduct psychosocial activities to support the emotional recovery of the survivors[10][3]. The coordinated response aimed to mitigate the long-term socio-economic impacts of the earthquake on the affected communities[11].

# Structural Damage

The 2022 West Java earthquake caused extensive structural damage across the region, significantly impacting both residential and public infrastructure. More than 22,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents from their homes[5][25]. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency reported that over 2,500 houses were classified as destroyed, alongside severe damage to four schools and a mosque[13][25]. Images from the aftermath depict a landscape of collapsed buildings, with photos of half-collapsed supermarkets and debris scattered across streets, including bricks and beams crushing vehicles[26][13].
In addition to residential buildings, the earthquake wreaked havoc on public facilities, affecting 18 offices and buildings, as well as 281 places of worship[19][27]. The damage to social infrastructure was profound, with reports indicating that 368 schools were either damaged or completely destroyed, emphasizing the urgent need for repair and reconstruction efforts[28][14].
Ground failure phenomena were also observed in the wake of the earthquake, including significant cracks in soil and asphalt roads, indicative of ground deformation[3]. In the Cugenang region, liquefaction was reported in alluvial deposits, resulting in the tilting of concrete structures[3]. These morphological changes highlighted the geological impacts of the seismic event, necessitating further geophysical studies to understand the underlying causes and risks[3].
Moreover, cascading hazards, such as co-seismic landslides, further complicated the disaster response efforts, as these secondary hazards exacerbated the overall impact of the earthquake and led to additional structural failures[29][22].

# Emergency Response

In the aftermath of the 2022 West Java earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 5.6, the Indonesian government led a coordinated emergency response involving various agencies and organizations. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) was instrumental in this effort, supported by local government bodies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to address the urgent needs of affected communities[14][6].

## Mobilization of Resources

The Indonesian Red Cross played a critical role by deploying relief and emergency teams to assist those impacted by the disaster. They mobilized five units of ambulances along with medical personnel and volunteers to facilitate urgent evacuations and conduct ground assessments[30][6]. Their efforts included providing first aid, distributing clean water, and setting up emergency kitchens in the most affected areas[6].
In addition, a joint search and rescue (SAR) team consisting of Basarnas (the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency) and the Indonesian Army, with support from the Navy’s Rapid Response Team for Disaster Management, was activated to conduct evacuations and deliver emergency relief supplies such as food, water, and medical supplies[20][3]. These operations also included relocating victims from destroyed homes and renovating damaged public facilities[20].

ASAR Humanity, among other local organizations, swiftly mobilized teams to provide immediate assistance, including hot meals, food packages, hygiene items, and medical services to those in need[3]. The Humanitarian Knowledge Hub (JMK) also played a significant role by facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration among local humanitarian organizations, emphasizing the importance of local leadership in disaster response[31].
The emergency response demonstrated the critical need for preparedness in Indonesia, a country prone to natural disasters. Experts emphasized the necessity of improved early warning systems to minimize impacts on vulnerable populations, particularly women and children[5][31].

# Aftermath

Following the 2022 West Java earthquake, significant abnormalities were observed during the initial aftermath, particularly from November 11th to November 23rd and later from December 5th to December 17th, 2022. During these intervals, the recorded sequences of aftershocks were 166 and 233, respectively[32][18]. The first period showed a notably lower frequency of aftershocks compared to the second, but it experienced greater subsidence, which was attributed to the mainshock that had a magnitude of Mw 5.6. In contrast, although aftershock occurrences escalated in the second period, a general decline in mean subsidence was noted[20][19].
The earthquake profoundly impacted the region, leading to the displacement of over 73,800 people due to the destruction of more than 22,000 homes[33][2]. Additionally, the infrastructure sustained severe damage, with reports indicating that 368 schools were either damaged or destroyed[1][15]. This catastrophe has raised urgent concerns regarding government preparedness and response capabilities, highlighting the need for improved disaster risk reduction and building regulations to enhance community resilience[11][12].
In the wake of the disaster, various humanitarian efforts were mobilized. Organizations such as ASAR Humanity worked tirelessly to provide immediate relief, including food distribution, medical services, and shelter kits for the affected populations[15]. The need for repairing and reconstructing schools was particularly emphasized, as educational facilities are crucial for restoring normalcy in the lives of children and their families[1]. The insights gained from this disaster response have implications for future earthquake preparedness and risk mitigation strategies, guiding policymakers in creating effective regulations and initiatives[2].
