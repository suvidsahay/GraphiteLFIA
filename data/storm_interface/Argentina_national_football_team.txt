# History

## Early Years and Development

The Argentina national football team was established in the early 20th century, reflecting the growing popularity of football in the country. By the 1910s, the team had begun to compete in international matches, participating in the inaugural Copa América in 1916, where they finished as runners-up. This marked the beginning of Argentina's significant presence in South American football, with the national team becoming a regular competitor in continental tournaments[1][2].

## Rise to Prominence

During the 1920s and 1930s, Argentina emerged as a powerhouse in South American football, with notable players and strong club competitions contributing to the team's success. The exodus of talented South American players to European clubs began after the 1930 World Cup, increasing the competitive standards and visibility of Argentine football on a global scale[3][4].

## The 1978 World Cup and Political Context

Argentina's triumph in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, held on home soil, was a pivotal moment in the country's football history. The tournament occurred against the backdrop of a military dictatorship, and the success of the national team was used by the junta to promote a sense of national pride amidst political repression. This era also saw the emergence of iconic players, including Diego Maradona, whose talents would further elevate Argentina's footballing stature in the years to come[6][7].

## Recent Achievements

The national team continued to perform strongly in international competitions, winning the Copa América multiple times and securing their second FIFA World Cup title in 1986, led by the legendary Maradona. In recent years, the team has remained competitive on the world stage, culminating in their victory at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they showcased their resilience and skill against a backdrop of high expectations from their passionate fan base[5].

## Football Culture and Rivalries

The culture of football in Argentina is characterized by intense rivalries, notably between clubs like Boca Juniors and River Plate, which often spill over into the national team's atmosphere. This fervor can lead to aggressive behavior among fans and players alike, a phenomenon that has historical roots dating back to the early decades of the 20th century[8][9]. The impact of these rivalries contributes to the team's identity and the emotional investment of supporters in their national side.

# Team Colors and Badge

## Kit History

The Argentina national football team has a rich history regarding its kits, which have evolved since their official debut. The first kit worn by Argentina in 1902 featured a light blue shirt[10][11]. On 2 July 1908, the team introduced a shirt with light blue vertical stripes on a white jersey, a design that has become synonymous with the team. This striped jersey was first used in an official match against Uruguay on 13 September 1908 and has remained the definitive kit for Argentina ever since[10][11][12]. The team's away kits have traditionally featured darker blue shades, with variations in the colors of shorts and socks over the years[10].
In November 2024, Argentina unveiled a special kit to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its partnership with Adidas, which began in 1974. This commemorative kit was debuted during a qualifier match for the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Peru[13][14][15].

## Badge

Argentina has utilized the logo of the Argentine Football Association (AFA) as its emblem since it was first worn at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Initially, the logo appeared only on the team's jackets, not on the shirts themselves. The AFA emblem was first used on jerseys during a match against the Soviet Union on 16 November 1976 at Estadio Monumental. The early design of the crest did not include a laurel wreath, which was first added for the 1982 World Cup[10][15][16][12].
In 2004, two stars were incorporated above the crest, representing Argentina's World Cup victories in 1978 and 1986. Following Argentina's triumph in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a third star was added, reflecting their status as world champions for the third time[10][14][16].

# Home Stadium

The home stadiums of the Argentina national football team have played a significant role in the history and culture of Argentine football. One of the earliest and most notable venues was GEBA Stadium, which hosted its first home match on 13 September 1908 against Uruguay. This match is historically significant as it marked the first time Argentina wore the iconic light blue and white-striped jersey in an official competition, a design that has become synonymous with the national team ever since[17][15]. GEBA was also the site of the Copa Centenario Revolución de Mayo in 1910, considered the first competition between South American national teams, and organized by the Argentine Football Association (AFA)[18].
Another notable venue is Estadio Sportivo Barracas, which served as a home ground for the national team from 1920 to 1932. It gained fame when forward Cesáreo Onzari scored the first-ever \"Olympic goal\" during a match against Uruguay on 2 October 1924, a moment that solidified its place in football history[19][20]. Unfortunately, Sportivo Barracas was demolished in 1936, marking the end of an era for the Argentine national team at that venue.
The atmosphere at Argentina's matches is electric, with passionate fans singing and chanting throughout the games, creating an unmatched sense of community and excitement among supporters[21]. This vibrant fan culture is particularly evident at the Estadio Presidente Juan Domingo Perón, also known as \"El Cilindro,\" the home ground of Racing Club de Avellaneda, where intense rivalries and spirited matches add to the experience of attending a game[22]. The combination of historical significance, memorable moments, and passionate fans has made Argentina's home stadiums pivotal to the identity of the national team.
