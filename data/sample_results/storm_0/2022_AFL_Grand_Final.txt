As the day of the Grand Final approached, anticipation grew. The MCG, a revered venue in Australian sports, was set to host the event, which is fondly referred to as "One Day in September" by footy enthusiasts. The atmosphere in Melbourne was electric, with fans from both sides buzzing with excitement. The sense of rivalry was palpable, as both teams prepared to seize the opportunity to lift the premiership cup.

The traditional pre-match festivities included a Grand Final parade, where players participated in a motorcade, meeting their adoring fans. This year, the parade was revamped to enhance visibility and engagement, showcasing the players and their journey throughout the season.

The third quarter only solidified their dominance, with Geelong leading 15.11 (101) to 4.3 (27) by the end of the period, effectively putting the game out of reach for the Swans.

The Sydney Swans struggled to find their rhythm, with several key players underperforming. Their score of 52 points marked their lowest of the season, a stark contrast to the offensive prowess they had displayed throughout the year. Notably, defensive errors, particularly from players like Tom McCartin, allowed Geelong to convert scoring opportunities that further widened the gap.
