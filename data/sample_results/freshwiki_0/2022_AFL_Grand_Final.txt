# 2022 AFL Grand Final: A Historic Clash of Titans

The 2022 AFL Grand Final unfolded as a monumental event in the realm of Australian rules football, showcasing a riveting contest between the Geelong Cats and the Sydney Swans. Hosted at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground on September 24, 2022, this marked the 127th grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL). With a crowd of 100,024 spectators, the atmosphere was electric, as Geelong secured a commanding 81-point victory, clinching their tenth VFL/AFL premiership. Isaac Smith emerged as a standout performer, earning the Norm Smith Medal for being the best player on the ground.

## Background: A Season of Resilience

As the 2022 season commenced, Geelong entered with a sense of urgency following a disappointing exit in the previous year's preliminary finals against the eventual champions, the Melbourne Demons. The Cats faced an inconsistent start, notching five wins and four losses in their opening games. However, they turned their season around spectacularly, remaining unbeaten for the rest of the home-and-away season, ultimately finishing with 18 wins and four losses. This impressive run earned them their second minor premiership in four years.

Geelong's path to the grand final included a narrow six-point victory over Collingwood in the qualifying final, followed by a stunning 71-point triumph over the Brisbane Lions in the preliminary final. This grand final marked Geelong's second appearance in three years, a testament to their enduring competitive spirit.

In contrast, the Sydney Swans sought redemption after a one-point elimination final loss to local rivals Greater Western Sydney in 2021. With a revamped roster, the Swans improved significantly, finishing third on the ladder with 16 wins and six losses. Their journey to the grand final featured a significant 22-point victory over the reigning champions Melbourne in the qualifying final, followed by a nail-biting one-point win against Collingwood in the preliminary final. This was Sydney's first grand final appearance since 2016.

The two teams had faced each other only once during the home-and-away season, a Round 2 match that saw Sydney victorious by 30 points, highlighted by Lance Franklin's remarkable 1000th career goal. As both teams entered the grand final on extensive winning streaks—Geelong winning their last fifteen games and Sydney nine—the stage was set for an epic showdown.

## Ceremonies and Entertainment: A Grand Celebration

The grand final festivities began with the return of the traditional Grand Final Parade, which had not been held in Melbourne since 2019 due to the pandemic. Players from both teams navigated the Yarra River on barges before transferring to utes for a procession through Yarra Park. Although the parade was a visual spectacle, it faced criticism for poor viewing angles along the riverbanks and for not reaching the anticipated spot at Princes Bridge, where many fans had gathered.

On the day of the match, the on-field ceremonies added to the grand atmosphere. The Premiership Cup was presented by Geelong legend Cameron Ling, a member of Geelong's premiership teams in 2007, 2009, and 2011, alongside former Sydney captain Paul Kelly. After the match, Ling presented the cup to Geelong's coach Chris Scott and captain Joel Selwood. Adding a sentimental touch, Selwood carried Levi Ablett, the son of dual premiership player Gary Ablett Jr., through the team's banner. Levi, diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease, represented the spirit and resilience that defines the Geelong Cats.

## Match Summary: A Display of Dominance

### First Quarter: Geelong Takes Charge

The match commenced with Geelong veteran Tom Hawkins registering the first behind within the opening minute. Geelong quickly established dominance in play and territory. Despite early resistance from Sydney, Hawkins broke the deadlock with the opening goal, snatching the ball from a ruck contest and deftly snapping it through the posts. Just five minutes later, he added another, extending Geelong's lead to 13 points.

Sydney's Will Hayward managed to score the Swans' first goal in the 17th minute, momentarily halting Geelong's momentum. However, Geelong rapidly reasserted control, kicking three goals within five minutes. Mark Blicavs opened his account with a set shot from 25 meters, followed by two goals from Isaac Smith, showcasing Geelong's attacking prowess. By the end of the first quarter, Geelong led by a staggering 41 to 6, marking the largest scoring margin any team had achieved in a grand final since 1989.

### Second Quarter: Sydney's Fightback

Sydney emerged from the quarter-time break with renewed determination, winning the opening clearance, though Lance Franklin's behind highlighted their struggles. Geelong continued to dominate territory, recording 18 out of 19 consecutive inside-50s at one point. Tyson Stengle kicked a goal for Geelong, but Sydney began to find their rhythm, with Hayden McLean scoring Sydney's second goal in the 9th minute.

The momentum shifted slightly as Sydney's competitiveness improved, leading to a more balanced contest. Hawkins added to Geelong's tally with his third goal, while Callum Mills responded for Sydney with a long-range effort. By halftime, Geelong maintained a comfortable lead of 62 to 26.

### Third Quarter: A Crushing Blow

Geelong's dominance became even more evident in the third quarter, as they kicked three quick goals within the first six minutes, effectively sealing the game. Mitch Duncan, Brad Close, and Isaac Smith found the target, extending Geelong's lead to 54 points. Sydney struggled to recover, managing only a single shot on goal for the quarter, which resulted in a behind. 

As the quarter progressed, Geelong continued to dictate play, adding another three goals. By three-quarter time, the scoreboard read Geelong 101 to Sydney 27, leaving little doubt about the eventual outcome.

### Final Quarter: A Fitting Conclusion

Although the final quarter was played with reduced intensity, it remained lively as both teams exchanged goals. Sydney's Chad Warner opened the scoring before Geelong's Jeremy Cameron added to their tally. Brandan Parfitt, who had recently entered the match as a substitute, scored shortly after, followed by further contributions from Sydney and Geelong players alike.

As the game drew to a close, Geelong finished with a resounding score of 133 to 52, cementing their dominance throughout the match. The Cats' statistical superiority was evident in numerous categories, including inside-50s, contested possessions, and total disposals, illustrating their comprehensive control of the game.

## Norm Smith Medal: A Well-Deserved Honor

Isaac Smith’s exceptional performance throughout the grand final earned him the Norm Smith Medal, awarded to the best player on the ground. With a game-high 32 disposals, 772 meters gained, three goals, and 14 total score involvements, Smith played a pivotal role in Geelong's victory. Notably, at age 33, he became the oldest recipient of the medal in its history. The medal was presented by Nathan Buckley, the 2002 Norm Smith Medallist.

Patrick Dangerfield and Tyson Stengle also stood out, with Dangerfield polling ten votes for his crucial role in the midfield and Stengle finishing as the leading goalkicker with four goals. The overall contributions from Geelong's players solidified their status as a cohesive and formidable team.

## Teams: A Clash of Strengths

Geelong's starting lineup featured one change from their preliminary final team. Wingman Max Holmes was initially included but was replaced by medical substitute Mark O'Connor on game day. Meanwhile, Brandan Parfitt was named as the substitute. The grand final was particularly significant for Geelong captain Joel Selwood, who surpassed Michael Tuck's record for the most career VFL/AFL finals played, becoming a four-time premiership player. Just days later, Selwood announced his retirement, adding a layer of emotional resonance to his final game.

Sydney made one change as well, opting to bring in Hayden McLean for Logan McDonald. The decision to select Sam Reid, who had recently suffered an adductor strain, drew criticism as he had limited impact before being substituted out due to a recurrence of his injury.

### Umpires

The officiating panel for the match included three field umpires, four boundary umpires, and two goal umpires, with John Sutcliffe, a veteran of the 1977 VFL Grand Final, presenting the umpires' medals post-match.

## Media Coverage: A Grand Spectacle

The media coverage of the 2022 AFL Grand Final was extensive, with the Seven Network holding exclusive broadcast rights in Australia for the eleventh consecutive year. Their coverage was led by James Brayshaw and Brian Taylor, featuring special comments from Luke Hodge and Daisy Pearce. Fox Footy also provided its own coverage, including pre-match, half-time, and post-match analysis, which was simulcast on Kayo Sports.

Despite the grand final's historical significance, viewer ratings fell short of expectations, with an average of 2.18 million viewers tuning in—making it the lowest-rated broadcast of modern history, aside from the 1993 Grand Final. However, the event still captivated the nation, peaking at 5.76 million viewers.

In the aftermath of the match, discussions arose regarding the timing of the grand final, as Channel Seven's boss suggested a return to a twilight or evening slot to boost ratings in future years.

## Conclusion: A Legacy Defined

The 2022 AFL Grand Final will be remembered not only for Geelong's commanding victory but also for the emotional narratives woven throughout the event. From the return of the Grand Final Parade to the poignant moments shared by players and fans alike, the day encapsulated the spirit of Australian football.
