# 2022 Hungarian Parliamentary Election: A Detailed Analysis

On April 3, 2022, Hungary witnessed a pivotal parliamentary election that not only shaped the nation's political landscape but also drew considerable attention from international observers. The election coincided with a referendum, amplifying its significance and the stakes involved. As the results were tallied, incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of the Fidesz party celebrated his party's resounding victory, declaring, "We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels." This statement encapsulated both the triumph and the complexities of the electoral context in Hungary, highlighting deep divisions within society and the political sphere.

## Context of the Election

### Electoral Law Changes

The backdrop to the 2022 election was defined by significant changes to Hungary's electoral law, enacted in December 2020. With a commanding two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, the ruling coalition pushed through amendments that increased the number of constituency candidates a party needed to run from 27 to 71 and expanded the requirement from nine counties to at least 14, including Budapest. These adjustments were perceived as strategic moves to strengthen Fidesz's grip on power, complicating the landscape for opposition parties and potentially disenfranchising voters.

### The Opposition's Response

In response to Fidesz's dominance, opposition parties recognized the necessity for unity to challenge the long-standing rule of Orbán. The 2019 local elections demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperation among various parties, prompting a coalition to form ahead of the 2022 election. This coalition included the Democratic Coalition, Jobbik, LMP, MSZP, Momentum Movement, and Dialogue, among others. In a historic first, they conducted a primary election in September and October 2021 to select a single candidate for prime minister, culminating in the nomination of Péter Márki-Zay, a candidate who represented a diverse yet ideologically varied alliance.

## The Hungarian Electoral System

The National Assembly of Hungary is composed of 199 members elected through a mixed-member majoritarian system. Within this framework, 106 members are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting, while 93 are elected from a nationwide party list via proportional representation, employing a partially compensatory system. The electoral threshold is set at 5%, but this increases to 10% for coalitions of two parties and 15% for coalitions of three or more, thereby incentivizing smaller parties to collaborate.

Critics have accused the Fidesz government of gerrymandering, manipulating electoral boundaries to benefit their candidates. This practice has resulted in smaller constituencies with more concentrated Fidesz support, thereby minimizing the number of votes required for their candidates to win. Furthermore, provisions allowing ethnic minorities to earn representation by achieving a lower quota of party list votes were introduced to enhance diversity in the assembly.

## Election Results and Their Implications

When the dust settled on election night, Fidesz emerged victorious with an astonishing 54.13% of the popular vote—a level of support unseen since the fall of communism in 1989. This victory translated into 135 out of 199 parliamentary seats, solidifying their supermajority. The opposition coalition, united under the banner of "United for Hungary," secured 57 seats, while the far-right Mi Hazánk party made its parliamentary debut with 6 seats. Despite predictions of a closer race, Orbán's victory was characterized by various media outlets as a "crushing success."

### The Aftermath of the Election

Orbán's victory speech was not merely a celebration; it served as a direct challenge to his opponents, the Hungarian left, international media, and foreign leaders. The atmosphere was charged, reflecting broader societal divisions within Hungary. Opposition leader Márki-Zay acknowledged the coalition's failure to effectively mobilize support, emphasizing a need for introspection and strategy moving forward.

#### Analyzing the Factors Behind Fidesz's Success

Several factors contributed to Fidesz's electoral triumph. Foremost among these was the party’s extensive control over the media landscape, which enabled them to shape public narratives in their favor. The geopolitical context, particularly the instability caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also played a crucial role. In times of uncertainty, voters often gravitate towards established leadership, which in this case, resulted in a rallying effect around Orbán.

Additionally, the opposition coalition struggled with ideological disunity, failing to present a cohesive message that resonated with rural voters. Analysts pointed out that Fidesz performed particularly well in regions with lower educational attainment and higher birth rates, while the opposition found stronger support in urban centers, particularly Budapest. This urban-rural divide underscored the challenges the opposition faced in bridging varying voter preferences.

## Conduct of the Election

The conduct of the election drew scrutiny from international observers, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). While they recognized that the legal framework allowed for a democratic process, they highlighted several shortcomings that failed to meet international standards. Despite a peaceful election day, concerns surrounding media bias, opaque campaign funding, and the intertwining of state and party messaging cast shadows over the process's integrity.

Organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Freedom House echoed these concerns, labeling the election as neither free nor fair. The overwhelming influence of the Fidesz party over the media and the electoral process raised alarms about the state of democracy in Hungary.

### Anomalies in Postal Voting

A particularly controversial aspect of the election involved postal voting, especially for Hungarian citizens living abroad. Since 2014, these citizens had the option to vote by mail; however, critics argued that the system lacked adequate safeguards against potential fraud. Reports of irregularities surfaced, including claims of individuals casting votes on behalf of family members without proper consent. The Fidesz party received a disproportionate share of these postal votes, leading to allegations of manipulation.

One notable incident involved the discovery of a bag of burnt postal ballots, all marked for opposition parties, in Romania. This scandal ignited outrage among opposition leaders, prompting calls for an annulment of postal voting. The National Election Commission’s refusal to investigate the matter further deepened suspicions of electoral misconduct, raising questions about the overall integrity of the voting process.

## International Reactions

The aftermath of the election drew varied responses on the international stage. Leaders from countries like Russia and India congratulated Orbán on his victory, signaling support from several authoritarian or right-leaning governments. In contrast, the European Union faced scrutiny for its approach to Hungary’s democratic backsliding. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to cut funding to Hungary due to concerns over the rule of law.

This juxtaposition of support from non-Western leaders and criticism from European institutions highlighted the geopolitical ramifications of Hungary's election results. The tensions between the Hungarian government and EU institutions were expected to escalate in the wake of this electoral outcome, raising concerns about Hungary's future within the European community.

## Future Implications

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election represented a crucial juncture in the nation's political trajectory. Orbán's victory not only reaffirmed his power but also illuminated the fractures within the opposition. The electoral process, while operationally sound on election day, raised pressing questions about the fairness and transparency of the overall system.

As Hungary grapples with its path forward, the implications of this election will reverberate throughout its political landscape for years to come. The electorate's desire for stability, coupled with the Fidesz party's entrenched position in the media and institutional frameworks, suggests that Orbán's administration will continue to dominate the political arena.

However, the election also presents opportunities for reflection and potential renewal among opposition factions. In the wake of their defeat, opposition leaders must reassess their strategies and forge a more united approach to effectively engage voters. The potential for dialogue among diverse political factions remains a possibility, albeit a challenging one, as they seek to present a compelling alternative to the ruling party.

## Conclusion

In summary, the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was a decisive event that underscored the complexities of the nation's political dynamics. While Fidesz's victory solidified its power, it also exposed deep societal divisions and the significant challenges facing the opposition. The electoral process, although marked by procedural integrity on the day itself, revealed concerning trends regarding media influence and electoral fairness.

As Hungary navigates its future, both domestically and in its relationship with the European Union, the repercussions of this election will be felt widely. The nation stands at a crossroads, with the potential for further polarization or the emergence of renewed political engagement. The path forward holds critical implications for the future of democracy in Hungary and its standing in the broader European context.
