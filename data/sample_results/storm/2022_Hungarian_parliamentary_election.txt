# summary

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, held on April 3, marked a pivotal moment in Hungary's political landscape, resulting in a decisive victory for the ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. This election was conducted under a reformed electoral system that shifted the balance of power within the National Assembly by increasing the number of single-member districts and reducing party-list representation, which critics argue further entrenched Fidesz's dominance in Hungarian politics.[1][2][3] The election occurred against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which influenced public sentiment and the electoral discourse.[4][5]
In the lead-up to the election, opposition parties attempted to unify against Fidesz through a coalition called United for Hungary, nominating Péter Márki-Zay as their candidate for prime minister.[6][7] However, the opposition's efforts were hindered by internal divisions and a biased media landscape favoring the incumbent government. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) reported significant imbalances in media access, which compromised the opposition's campaign effectiveness and contributed to a lack of competitive parity.[8][9][10] Ultimately, Fidesz secured 54.3% of party-list votes and retained a super-majority in Parliament, illustrating the formidable challenges faced by the fragmented opposition.[11][12]
The election results ignited considerable controversy regarding electoral integrity and democratic backsliding in Hungary, with critics citing the ruling party's manipulation of electoral laws and media control as detrimental to fair competition.[10][13] Furthermore, the accompanying referendum on sexual education garnered minimal public engagement, failing to meet the threshold for validity due to low voter turnout.[8][14] The aftermath of the election has seen intensified polarization within Hungarian society, raising concerns about the future of democratic institutions and the efficacy of opposition parties in mounting a viable challenge against the entrenched power of Fidesz.[15][16][17]
As Hungary navigates the implications of this election amidst ongoing geopolitical challenges, the effectiveness of the opposition and the ruling party's strategies will be critical in shaping the future political landscape.[18][19] The elections have underscored the increasing complexities of Hungarian politics, where external crises and internal divisions have profound effects on governance and public engagement.[20][17][3]

# Overview

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was conducted under a reformed electoral system that was implemented following a significant reform in 2012. This reform established a one-round, two-ballot system, which dramatically altered the electoral landscape. The total number of seats in the National Assembly was reduced, and regional party lists were eliminated, leading to a greater emphasis on single-member districts. Specifically, the proportion of single-member seats increased from 45.56% to 53.3% of the total seats[1][2].
In this electoral framework, voters participated in two ballots: the first ballot was used to elect Members of Parliament (MPs) for 106 single-member districts through a first-past-the-post method. The second ballot allowed voters to cast their votes for national party lists, with the allocation of the remaining 93 national seats based on the sum of votes received in the second ballot and the wasted votes from the first ballot. Wasted votes refer to those cast for unsuccessful candidates or surplus votes for winning candidates[1][3].
The 2014 elections were the first to utilize this revised electoral system, which aimed to enhance electoral efficiency and representation. The significant change from a two-round system to a single-round election was anticipated to impact voter turnout and the overall political dynamics within the assembly[1][21].

# Timeline

## Pre-Election Developments

In the lead-up to the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, significant political maneuvering took place among opposition parties, which were ideologically diverse yet politically weak[8][6]. In an effort to challenge the long-standing dominance of the incumbent Fidesz party, a primary election was conducted in September and October 2021 to select a leading candidate from an opposition alliance. Péter Márki-Zay emerged as the candidate to run for the prime ministerial office[4][7].

## Electoral Campaign

The electoral campaign was notably influenced by external factors, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This geopolitical event prompted an influx of thousands of refugees into Hungary, heightening public interest and scrutiny of the government's response[4][5]. The ruling party's historical ties with Russian authorities added complexity to the campaign, further polarizing the electorate[8][14].

## Election Day and Results

On April 3, 2022, the parliamentary election took place alongside a government-initiated referendum concerning sexual education for children[8][14]. Preliminary results indicated that Fidesz had successfully renewed its super-majority in Parliament, with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán securing a new mandate[4][5]. However, the referendum did not yield a valid result, as less than half of the eligible voters participated in the voting process[8][7].

# Political Parties

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was significantly influenced by the political landscape dominated by the ruling party, Fidesz, and the various opposition parties that struggled to mount an effective challenge.

## Ruling Party Dynamics

Fidesz, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, utilized its parliamentary supermajority to manipulate electoral conditions to its advantage. Since 2010, the party has engaged in practices such as redrawing constituency boundaries to ensure electoral dominance, further consolidating its power by enacting laws that benefit its position, including amendments to electoral laws regarding permanent addresses in November 2021[10][8]. In the 2022 election, Fidesz garnered 54.3% of party list votes and secured 67.84% of parliamentary seats, reflecting its significant influence over the electoral process[11].

## Opposition Challenges

Opposition parties in Hungary have been described as ideologically diverse yet politically weak, facing numerous obstacles that hindered their electoral effectiveness. These challenges included a biased media landscape, where the public broadcaster exhibited clear political favoritism towards Fidesz, and the overlap between state resources and ruling party campaigns, which blurred the lines between government and party activities[10][6]. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted the intimidating rhetoric employed by the government, which discouraged public participation in election observation and diminished the ability of opposition candidates to compete freely[8][9].
Furthermore, the political landscape for opposition parties has been marked by the politicization of advertising markets, making it difficult for them to gain visibility. The ruling party's dominance in both financial resources and media coverage has led to an environment where opposition messages struggle to penetrate the public sphere[10][12].

## The Opposition Alliance

In an effort to counter Fidesz's dominance, several opposition parties, including the Democratic Coalition (DK), Jobbik, and the Momentum Movement, formed a coalition. However, the alliance lacked a clear and coherent policy platform, leading to a homogenization of values rather than a strong unified front[22][12]. The results of the 2022 election reflected these difficulties, as the alliance received only 34.44% of party list votes and 28.64% of parliamentary seats[11]. Notably, Jobbik, which was expected to secure around 20% of support, suffered significant losses, dropping from 26 seats in 2018 to just nine in 2022[12][9].

# Election Results

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, held on April 3, resulted in a decisive victory for Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party, which secured a majority of the votes despite expectations of a closer race. Fidesz won a significant number of single-member districts and achieved 34.44% of the party-list votes, illustrating the challenges faced by the opposition in their efforts to unify against the incumbent government[23][12][5].

## Voter Turnout

The voter turnout for the election was 69.54% of the 7,536,306 eligible voters, a slight decrease from the 70.22% turnout in the 2018 election. This turnout excludes registered voters living abroad[20][13]. The election did not have any turnout requirements, a change from previous elections where a 50% turnout was necessary for the first round and 25% for the second round[22].

## Electoral Changes

Significant changes were made to the electoral system ahead of the 2022 elections. The National Assembly was reduced to 199 seats from the previous 386, with 106 constituency seats (down from 176) and 93 party-list seats (including minority-list seats, reduced from 210). The share of constituency seats increased from 45.6% to 53.3% of total seats, while party-list seats decreased from 54.4% to 46.7%[22][18]. Additionally, a 5% threshold remained for party lists, 10% for joint lists of two parties, and 15% for joint lists of three or more parties. Ethnic-minority lists faced a quota that was only one-quarter of the general quota[20].

## Observations and Criticism

The election was observed by over 200 representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Their report noted that while procedural issues were minimal, there was no level playing field between the opposition and the Fidesz government, which exerted near-complete control over the media landscape. For instance, opposition parties were limited to only five minutes of speaking time on state-funded media during the campaign[13][18]. This media dominance contributed to the opposition's underperformance, which was below the levels predicted by opinion polls prior to the election[24][5].
The results reflect a political landscape where strategic cooperation among opposition parties alone proved insufficient to challenge the governing Fidesz party effectively, highlighting the entrenched nature of Orbán's support and the difficulties faced by opposition coalitions in mobilizing voter support[12][5].

# Reactions

## Domestic Reactions

The aftermath of the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election has been marked by a significant polarization of political discourse within Hungary. High levels of political antagonism have been observed between supporters of the government and opposition parties, exacerbated by confrontational narratives and political hate speech that have become commonplace in public communication[15][25]. The government has notably targeted perceived \"public enemies,\" including figures like George Soros and issues surrounding migration, integrating these themes into its political strategy[25][5].
Despite the charged atmosphere, religious or ethnic confrontations have remained largely absent, with the polarization instead manifesting through traditional societal cleavages, such as state versus church and labor versus capital. This political climate has hindered any substantial mass mobilization, with few incidents of violence reported, and public protests featuring cross-sectional societal cooperation being virtually nonexistent[15][26].

## International Reactions

Internationally, the war in Ukraine has complicated Hungary's foreign relations, particularly affecting its ties with Poland, which has maintained a pro-Ukraine stance. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's continued connection with Russian leadership has generated concerns about Hungary's alignment within the Western geopolitical framework, especially given the West's sanctions against Russia and efforts to reduce reliance on China[20][16]. The evolving situation has led to apprehensions that a potential shift in Poland's government following the 2023 elections could further isolate Hungary within Western alliances, potentially weakening the previously established autocratic collaboration between Hungary and Poland[20][16].
The broader implications of Hungary's political situation and its foreign policy choices highlight the challenges Orbán faces as he navigates between Eastern and Western powers amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. This balancing act raises questions about Hungary's commitment to democratic institutions, as the government's exploitation of crises—first the COVID-19 pandemic and now the war in Ukraine—has led to a notable concentration of executive power and a decline in the legitimacy of democratic practices[9][26].

# Implications

The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election has significant implications for the political landscape in Hungary. Following the election, the Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, successfully renewed its super-majority in Parliament, which solidifies its control over government functions and policymaking[5][19]. This reinforced mandate allows Fidesz to continue its strategy of consolidating power over both public and private entities, further marginalizing a weak and fragmented opposition[17][18].

## Opposition Dynamics

The opposition, represented by the United for Hungary alliance, is characterized by ideological diversity but political weakness. Internal strife has emerged, with leaders blaming one another for their poor electoral performance, which complicates efforts to mount a united challenge against Fidesz[5][18]. The opposition's strategy of competing for leadership positions among themselves in the European Parliament elections, rather than coordinating efforts for the local elections, has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among voters[25][13]. The infighting within the opposition is likely to hinder its effectiveness in future elections, including the upcoming European Parliament elections scheduled for 2024[27].

## Impact of External Factors

The geopolitical context, particularly the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, may also influence Hungarian politics. This situation could enhance the role of the European Union and NATO within Hungary, affecting public opinion and government policies. Fidesz's popular initiatives, such as support for pensioners and pro-natalist measures aimed at young families, may continue to resonate with voters, although the long-term viability of these policies is questioned due to rising inflation and skilled labor emigration[17][18][3].

## Future Considerations

As Hungary approaches its next electoral cycle, the challenges faced by the opposition and the Fidesz government's ability to maintain public support amidst economic uncertainties will be critical areas to monitor. The potential for further fragmentation within the opposition could enable Fidesz to strengthen its grip on power even more, while rising public dissatisfaction due to economic conditions may pose risks to its long-term dominance[18][3].
