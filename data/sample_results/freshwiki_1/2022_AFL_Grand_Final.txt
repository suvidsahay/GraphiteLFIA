# The 2022 AFL Grand Final: A Celebration of Football and Community

Can you imagine the energy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on September 24, 2022? With 100,024 passionate fans packed into the stands, the atmosphere was electric, buzzing with anticipation as Geelong and Sydney prepared to clash in the 127th AFL Grand Final. This wasn't just another match; it was the culmination of an arduous season, a display of resilience, skill, and the unbreakable spirit of Australian rules football. As the final siren echoed through the stadium, Geelong emerged victorious, defeating Sydney by an astounding 81 points to claim their tenth VFL/AFL premiership.

In the midst of this thrilling encounter, Isaac Smith shone brightly, being awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his exceptional performance. His achievement added another layer of excitement to a day filled with unforgettable moments and stories.

## The Journey to the Grand Final

The journey to the grand final was marked by determination and resilience for both teams. Geelong entered the 2022 season with a burning desire to redeem themselves after a heartbreaking preliminary final loss to Melbourne the previous year. The Cats faced early challenges, starting the season with five wins and four losses. Yet, like seasoned warriors, they regrouped, embarking on a remarkable 15-game winning streak. Their efforts culminated in a minor premiership, boasting an impressive record of 18 wins and 4 losses. In the qualifying final, they narrowly defeated Collingwood by six points, followed by a commanding 71-point victory over the Brisbane Lions in the preliminary final.

Sydney's journey was equally compelling. After suffering a heart-wrenching exit from the 2021 season—losing to Greater Western Sydney by just one point—the Swans returned in 2022 with renewed vigor and determination. Finishing third on the ladder with 16 wins, they showcased their resilience and grit. Sydney's path to the grand final included a stunning 22-point victory over reigning premiers Melbourne in the qualifying final, followed by a nail-biting one-point win against Collingwood in the preliminary final. The stage was set for an epic showdown, with both teams carrying momentum into the match.

Interestingly, the two clubs had only met once during the home-and-away season, in Round 2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. That encounter was memorable for Lance Franklin's remarkable achievement of scoring his 1000th career goal, with Sydney claiming victory by 30 points. Now, they faced off in the grand final, adding a layer of intrigue to their rivalry.

## Ceremonies and Entertainment

As the day approached, excitement reverberated throughout Melbourne, culminating in the much-anticipated Grand Final Parade. This was the first time the parade returned since 2019, and it was a spectacle to behold. Picture players cruising along the Yarra River on barges, waving to fans who lined the banks, before boarding utes for a festive journey through Yarra Park, culminating just north of the MCG. Despite some fans expressing disappointment over limited viewing angles during the river portion, the camaraderie and excitement were palpable.

Once the match was near, the on-field ceremonies began. The prestigious Premiership Cup made its grand entrance, carried onto the field by Geelong legend Cameron Ling and former Sydney captain Paul Kelly. After the match, Ling presented the cup to Geelong's coach Chris Scott and captain Joel Selwood. One particularly touching moment occurred when Selwood carried Levi Ablett, the son of Geelong great Gary Ablett Jr. and grandson of Gary Ablett Sr., through the team banner. Levi, diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease, became a beacon of hope and resilience, embodying the spirit of the Geelong community.
