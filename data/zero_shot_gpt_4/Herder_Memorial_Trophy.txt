# Herder Memorial Trophy

## Overview

The Herder Memorial Trophy, often simply referred to as the Herder, is a prestigious accolade in the world of Canadian ice hockey. Named in memory of the Herder family who founded The Evening Telegram newspaper in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the trophy has been awarded annually since 1935 to the provincial senior hockey champion.

Representing the pinnacle of non-professional hockey in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Herder Trophy has a rich history and has been won by a diverse range of teams and players. Its recipients have included several athletes who went on to have successful careers in professional leagues, reinforcing the competition's reputation for high-level play.

## History

### Origins

The Herder Memorial Trophy was first introduced in 1935 by Ralph Herder of The Evening Telegram as a tribute to three of his brothers - Arthur, William, and Robert - who had passed away. The Herder brothers were instrumental in the development of ice hockey in Newfoundland and Labrador.

The trophy was initially awarded to the winner of the Newfoundland Senior Hockey League (NSHL). The competition was open to teams from across the province, and matches were intensely contested, often drawing large crowds. The early winners included the Grand Falls Andcos and the Corner Brook Royals, teams that would go on to enjoy considerable success in the tournament.

### Evolution

Over the years, the format of the competition has changed numerous times, often in response to shifts in the landscape of Canadian ice hockey. However, the fundamental objective of the tournament has remained consistent: to identify and honor the top senior hockey team in Newfoundland and Labrador.

### Significant Years

In 1986, the NSHL folded, leading to a brief period of uncertainty for the Herder Trophy. However, it was quickly adopted as the championship prize for the newly formed Newfoundland Senior Hockey League.

In 2011, following several years of declining participation, the tournament was rebranded as the Herder Memorial Championship Series. This move was intended to reinvigorate the competition and attract new teams and players.
