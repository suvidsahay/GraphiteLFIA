The **Archie Battersbee case** is a poignant example of the complex interplay between medical ethics, parental rights, and legal frameworks. Archie, a 12-year-old boy from Southend, Essex, became the center of a legal battle in the United Kingdom concerning the continuation of life support for patients diagnosed with severe brain injuries.

## Incident and Medical Condition

On April 7, 2022, Archie Battersbee was found unconscious at his home by his mother, Hollie Dance, with a ligature around his neck. Paramedics were called, and upon arrival, they noted that Archie had suffered a cardiac arrest and exhibited a Glasgow Coma Scale score of three, indicating deep unconsciousness. After initial resuscitation efforts at Southend University Hospital, he was transferred to The Royal London Hospital for specialized care. Medical assessments suggested that Archie had sustained significant brain damage due to prolonged lack of oxygen. citeturn0search1

Hollie Dance speculated that Archie might have been participating in an online challenge known as the "blackout challenge," which encourages individuals to asphyxiate themselves to achieve a brief euphoric state. However, during a pre-inquest review on November 8, 2022, Essex's senior coroner, Lincoln Brookes, stated that there was no evidence to substantiate the claim that Archie had been engaging in such an online challenge at the time of the incident. citeturn0search1

## Legal Proceedings

The medical team at The Royal London Hospital, after thorough evaluations, concluded that Archie was brainstem dead and recommended the withdrawal of life support. Archie's parents opposed this recommendation, leading to a series of legal proceedings to determine the best course of action.

### High Court Decisions

In May 2022, the Barts Health NHS Trust sought a legal declaration from the High Court to perform brainstem testing on Archie, which his parents had refused. Mrs. Justice Arbuthnot ruled that such tests were in Archie's best interests. Subsequent tests indicated no discernible brain activity. On June 13, 2022, Justice Arbuthnot declared that Archie was legally dead based on brainstem criteria and authorized the withdrawal of life support. citeturn0search1

### Court of Appeal and Supreme Court

Archie's parents appealed the High Court's decision. On June 29, 2022, the Court of Appeal overturned the initial ruling, stating that evidence should be reconsidered by a different judge. citeturn0search4 However, subsequent hearings upheld the decision to withdraw life support. The family sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, which was denied on August 2, 2022. citeturn0search1

### International Appeals

In a bid to prolong Archie's life support, his family approached the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). The UNCRPD requested that the UK delay withdrawing life support while it reviewed the case. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the UNCRPD's request was not binding under UK law, and the withdrawal proceeded as planned. citeturn0search1
