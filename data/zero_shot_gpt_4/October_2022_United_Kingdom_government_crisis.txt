Title: A Comprehensive Study of the 2008 Economic Crisis

# Introduction
## Overview
The 2008 economic crisis is one of the most significant global financial downturns since the Great Depression. The crisis, which began in the United States, had far-reaching implications that transcended borders, impacting economies worldwide. The crisis was a culmination of a series of events including poor government decisions, an unpredictable public reaction, and unfavorable economic and political situations. This article examines the lead-up, the events, major players, impacts, and resolution of the 2008 economic crisis.

# Background
## Economic Situation
Before the 2008 economic crisis, there was a housing bubble in the United States due to the surge in property prices. Mortgage lenders began offering loans to subprime borrowers, who were risky due to their low creditworthiness. This situation was unsustainable and, inevitably, the bubble burst. 

## Political Situation
In 2008, political dynamics were in transition. George W. Bush, then the president, was nearing the end of his tenure. The political landscape was fraught with uncertainty, and the upcoming presidential elections added to the tumultuous atmosphere.

# Build-up to the Crisis
## Government Decisions
The government, under President Bush's administration, had adopted a deregulation policy for the financial sector. This leniency allowed financial institutions to engage in high-risk lending and investment activities, contributing significantly to the housing bubble.

## Public Reaction
As house prices rose, many Americans took the opportunity to purchase homes, often borrowing more than they could afford. This, combined with predatory lending practices, contributed to the inevitable burst of the housing bubble.

# Events of the Crisis

The crisis reached a tipping point in October 2008. Lehman Brothers, a significant investment bank, filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, sending shockwaves through the financial sector.
