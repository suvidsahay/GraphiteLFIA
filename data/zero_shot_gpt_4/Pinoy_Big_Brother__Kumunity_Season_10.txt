Introduction

Pinoy Big Brother (PBB) is a reality television show that airs in the Philippines and follows the Big Brother franchise which was first popularized in the Netherlands. The show was first launched in August 2005 and has since enjoyed a successful run with multiple seasons including celebrity and teen editions. The program revolves around a group of people, known as "housemates," living together in a large, purpose-built house, under 24/7 video surveillance. Their lives inside the house are filmed and broadcasted to the public, who have a hand in deciding who stays and who gets evicted through voting.

Format

Basic Structure

In Pinoy Big Brother, a group of people, known as housemates, live in a large, isolated house and are continuously monitored by cameras and microphones. The housemates are completely cut off from the outside world - they are not allowed access to phones, the internet, television, or any form of outside contact. They must live together, perform assigned tasks, and participate in competitions to avoid eviction.

Competitions

Weekly Tasks

In weekly tasks, the housemates must work together to accomplish a certain task assigned by Big Brother. The tasks are typically designed to test the housemates' teamwork, patience, physical and mental endurance. The success or failure of these tasks can affect their weekly budget for food and other necessities.

Immunity Challenges

Immunity challenges are held regularly, in which housemates compete for immunity from the next eviction. The winner of the immunity challenge is safe from the next round of public voting.
