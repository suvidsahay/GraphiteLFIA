# Armorial of Albania
The armorial of Albania comprises a wide array of symbols that hold historical, cultural, and political significance. This article provides an extensive look at the national, royal, ecclesiastical, civic, and military heraldry of the country. It also explores the indigenous and foreign influences that shaped Albania's heraldic tradition, and the legislation that governs the use of these symbols.

## Overview
### Historical Background
Heraldry in Albania, like in many other European countries, dates back to the Middle Ages. As early as the 13th century, Albanian noble families adopted coat of arms and heraldic devices to symbolize their lineage, power, and prestige. These symbols were typically displayed on shields, seals, banners, and buildings.

Over the centuries, Albania's heraldic tradition has been shaped by various influences, including its own indigenous culture, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and Western Europe. Each period left its mark, adding layers of complexity and diversity to the Albanian armorial.

## National Symbols of Albania
### National Emblem
#### Description
The national emblem of Albania is a red shield with a black, double-headed eagle in the center. Above the eagle is a helmet adorned with billy goats' heads, symbolizing the Albanian people's resilience and endurance. The eagle, a symbol of freedom and sovereignty, traces its origins back to the flag of Gjergj Kastrioti, also known as Skanderbeg, the national hero of Albania.

#### History
The emblem was officially adopted after the declaration of independence in 1912. However, it has undergone several changes reflecting the country's turbulent history. During the communist era (1946-1992), the emblem featured a gold-bordered red shield with a black eagle, and above it a five-pointed gold star. After the fall of communism, the emblem was revised to its original form.

### National Flag
#### Description
The national flag of Albania mirrors the national emblem, featuring a red field with a black, double-headed eagle in the center. It is a simple yet powerful symbol of the Albanian nation.

#### History
The flag was first used during the revolt of 1443 led by Skanderbeg against the Ottoman Empire. After Skanderbeg's death, the flag was forgotten until the 19th century, when the Albanian national awakening brought it back into use. It was officially adopted as the national flag when Albania declared independence in 1912.
