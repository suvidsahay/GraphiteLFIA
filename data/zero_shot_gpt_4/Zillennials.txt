They have witnessed the transition of the digital age, growing up with a combination of traditional media like books and television, and newer forms of technology such as smartphones and social media. They have a unique perspective on technology and its evolution, making them adaptable and versatile. They are also known for their social awareness, open-mindedness, and acceptance of diversity.
