# African Greeks

## Introduction
The African Greeks, known as Hellenic Africans, encompass a vibrant community of Greeks who have either migrated to or originated from various parts of the African continent. They're a unique ethnic group, which boasts a rich history, thriving demographics, and an exciting, colorful culture. This diverse groupâ€™s descendants can be traced back to different periods in history, including the ancient era when Hellenistic culture was spreading, the Byzantine period, and modern times, with the Greek diaspora spreading across the globe.

### Etymology 
The term "African Greek" is coined from the geographical identity of Africa and the ethnic identity of Greece. It is used to define the Greek communities who have made Africa their home over centuries. 

## History 

### Ancient History

#### Relations between Ancient Greece and Africa
Historically, the Greeks' connections with Africa are traced back to the ancient period when Greek explorers, traders, and settlers interacted with North African societies, particularly Egypt and Libya. The Greeks had a deep fascination with Egypt's profound knowledge and rich culture. This admiration is evident in Herodotus' historical works and the Greek scholars who studied in the ancient Library of Alexandria. This relationship resulted in a vibrant cultural exchange that had lasting impacts on Greek philosophy, architecture, and science.

### Middle Ages

#### Byzantine Period
In the Middle Ages, during the Byzantine period, Greek influence in Africa continued. In North Africa, the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, controlled several territories, including parts of modern-day Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia. The Byzantines defended these territories from various invasions, and in doing so, they extended their influence, spreading Greek Orthodox Christianity and Hellenic culture.

### Modern History

#### Greek Diaspora in Africa
In modern history, the Greek Diaspora in Africa took root in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a significant Greek population settling in countries like Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Sudan. Many of these Greeks migrated to Africa due to economic opportunities, political unrest, or war in their homeland. The Greek communities in Africa flourished, establishing Greek schools, churches, and business enterprises, thus marking their presence in their adopted homelands.

## Demographics 

### Population

#### By Country 
Greece's population in Africa is widespread, with Greek communities present in several African countries. Egypt, especially Alexandria, once had a thriving Greek community that numbered nearly half a million. South Africa is currently home to the largest Greek community in Africa, with approximately 120,000 Greeks. Other countries with significant Greek populations include Zimbabwe, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

### Language
The African Greeks primarily speak Greek, maintaining their ancestral language despite their diasporic existence. Additionally, they are multilingual, speaking the languages of their respective African host nations, including Arabic, English, French, and Afrikaans.

### Religion
The majority of African Greeks adhere to Greek Orthodox Christianity, which is a key part of their cultural identity. The Orthodox Church plays a central role in their communities, serving not only as a place of worship but also as a venue for social and cultural events.

These include dances like the 'Hasapiko', 'Zeibekiko', 'Kalamatianos' and the 'Sirtaki', which are integral to Greek celebrations. Traditional Greek music, with instruments like the Bouzouki, Baglamas, and Lyre, also plays a significant part in their cultural expressions.

Iconic Greek dishes like Moussaka, Souvlaki, Tzatziki, and Baklava are popular within these communities.

### Contemporary Figures
Contemporary African Greeks have also made significant strides in various fields. One notable figure is George Bizos, a renowned human rights lawyer born in Greece who emigrated to South Africa. He played a crucial role in the anti-apartheid movement, famously defending Nelson Mandela during the Rivonia Trial.
